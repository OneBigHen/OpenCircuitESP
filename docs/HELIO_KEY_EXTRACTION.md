# Getting your Amazfit Helio Strap's auth key

_Researched 2026-09-30 for #215. Methods break whenever Zepp changes its servers. Every
method below carries the most recent date we found showing it working. Re-check before
relying on this page._

## What the key is, and why you need it once

The Helio Strap refuses to share its stored history (sleep, HRV, SpO₂, temperature, steps…)
with any app that doesn't prove it knows a secret **auth key**. That key is 16 bytes, shown
as 32 hexadecimal characters (e.g. `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`, sometimes written with
a `0x` in front). It is created by **Zepp's servers** when you pair the strap in the Zepp
app. There is no known way to create it on the phone or on the strap.
([Gadgetbridge: Huami/Xiaomi server pairing](https://gadgetbridge.org/basics/pairing/huami-xiaomi-server/))

So the one-time cost of using a Helio Strap with OpenCircuit is:

1. pair the strap in the official Zepp app once;
2. copy the key out of your Zepp account (this page);
3. paste it into OpenCircuit.

After that OpenCircuit talks only to the strap. Nothing is sent to Zepp.

**Treat the key like a password.** Anyone with it and physical Bluetooth range can read your
strap's health data. Don't post it in bug reports or screenshots. OpenCircuit keeps it in
the iOS Keychain.

## What invalidates the key

| Action | Effect | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Unpairing** the strap in the Zepp app | key is invalidated; you must pair again and fetch a new key | Gadgetbridge pairing page (above) |
| **Factory reset** of the strap | the Bluetooth address changes, so you need a new key | same |
| Re-pairing in Zepp | issues a new key (follows from the two rows above) | inference |
| Reading the key (any method below) | **no effect**; it's a read-only lookup of your account | huami-token README; inference |
| Using the same key in several apps | works; the key is a shared secret, not a login session | Gadgetbridge wiki, per research notes (not re-verified) |

That is why the last step below says **delete** the Zepp app rather than "remove device".

## Before you start (all methods)

- **Pair, sync and update the strap in the Zepp app first.** The key only exists on Zepp's
  servers after pairing. The huami-token README asks for "pair, sync and update" before
  fetching.
- **Know how you log in to Zepp.** Method 2 needs a Zepp/Amazfit account with an **email and
  password**. If you signed up with Apple, Google or another social login, Method 2 won't
  work. The huami-token README says to create an email/password account in that case. Method 1
  uses the Zepp website's own login, which may support social login. We could not confirm that.
- **You need a computer (Mac, Windows or Linux) with a desktop web browser.** No method works
  from an iPhone alone (see "Methods compared" below).

## Method 1 (recommended): Zepp website + Gadgetbridge's console snippet

_No installs, about 5 minutes. Last confirmed: listed as a current method on Gadgetbridge's
pairing page, fetched 2026-09-30. The page itself carries no date._

1. On the computer, open **https://watchface.zepp.com/** and sign in with the **same Zepp
   account** your strap is paired to.
2. In the same browser tab, open Gadgetbridge's instructions at
   **https://gadgetbridge.org/basics/pairing/huami-xiaomi-server/** and find the section for
   the Zepp watchface website. Copy the snippet from **that page only**. Never paste code
   from anywhere else into a browser console: that is how account-stealing scams work.
3. Go back to the watchface.zepp.com tab and open the browser's developer console:
   - Chrome / Edge / Brave: `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac);
   - Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+K` / `Cmd+Option+K`;
   - Safari (Mac): first enable **Settings › Advanced › "Show features for web developers"**,
     then `Cmd+Option+C`.
4. Paste the snippet and press Enter. Some browsers first ask you to type something like
   `allow pasting`. Do that, then paste again. Allow a pop-up if the page asks.
5. The output lists your devices. Find the entry for the Helio Strap and, inside its
   `additionalInfo`, the value after **`"auth_key":`**. It is 32 characters of `0-9` and `a-f`.
   If you have several devices, match the strap by its name or MAC address.
6. Copy those 32 characters (with or without `0x`) into OpenCircuit.
7. Close the tab. Optionally sign out of watchface.zepp.com.

**If it fails:**
- *An empty list, or no `auth_key`*: the strap isn't paired to this account, or hasn't synced
  yet. Open Zepp, let it sync, and try again.
- *An error about the account or token*: sign out and back in on watchface.zepp.com. The snippet
  uses the login the website stored in your browser. Region: the snippet calls a US Zepp API
  host. We haven't confirmed whether EU or China accounts need a different host. If it fails
  for you, use Method 2.
- *The key is rejected in OpenCircuit ("wrong auth key")*: the strap was unpaired, re-paired
  or reset after you copied it. Fetch it again.

## Method 2 (fallback): the `huami-token` script

_Needs Python and a terminal, about 15–30 minutes the first time. Last confirmed: maintainer
removed the README's "not working" notice on **2026-02-24**, after Zepp changed its login API in
September 2025 and broke the tool for about five months. One user still reported a login
failure on 2026-02-26 (issue #127, open, no diagnosis)._
([codeberg.org/argrento/huami-token](https://codeberg.org/argrento/huami-token))

1. Install **Python 3.10 or newer** and the **`uv`** tool.
2. Download the project from codeberg (clone it), then install it from source as its README
   describes. The README says the PyPI package is outdated, so don't use `pip install huami-token`.
3. Run it with the Amazfit method, your Zepp **email and password**, and the Bluetooth-keys
   option. The README shows the exact command (`--method amazfit … --bt_keys`).
4. The output lists your devices with a key for each. Copy the Helio Strap's 32-character key
   into OpenCircuit.

**Failure modes:** social-login accounts (Apple/Google) can't sign in, so create an
email/password Zepp account and pair the strap under it. HTTP `401` means wrong email or
password. `400`/`429` responses and "cannot login" were the symptoms of the 2025 API change;
if they come back, the tool is broken again, so check its issue tracker. The Xiaomi-account
mode is currently broken by Xiaomi's 2FA (issue #119, April 2026), but that mode doesn't apply
to the Helio Strap.

## After you have the key

1. Paste it into OpenCircuit and let it connect and sync once.
2. **Delete the Zepp app** from your phone. **Don't** use "Remove device"/unpair inside Zepp.
   Unpairing invalidates the key. Deleting the app also stops Zepp from grabbing the Bluetooth
   connection away from OpenCircuit. (Gadgetbridge gives the same advice for all Zepp devices.)
3. Keep a copy of the key in your password manager. If you ever reinstall OpenCircuit, you can
   paste it again without touching Zepp.

Once Zepp is gone, the strap's firmware stays at its current version. That's stable, but you
won't get updates. If you need Zepp back later (for a firmware update, say), reinstall it and
sign in. **Don't** re-pair unless it forces you to. If it does, fetch a new key afterwards.

## Methods compared

| Method | Needs | Account type | Strap paired in Zepp first | Works from iPhone only | Breaks Zepp pairing | Last seen working |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. watchface.zepp.com + console snippet | computer + desktop browser | whatever the website accepts (social login unconfirmed) | yes | no (iPhone Safari has no console without a Mac) | no | listed as current 2026-09-30; no dated user report found |
| 2. `huami-token` (`--method amazfit`) | computer + Python 3.10+ + `uv` | **email + password** Zepp/Amazfit account | yes | no | no | README fix 2026-02-24 (one open failure report 2026-02-26) |
| 3. Rooted Android: read the key from the Zepp app's database | rooted Android phone | any | yes | no | no | undated (long-standing technique) |
| 4. HelioCore (third-party iOS app that logs into Zepp for you) | building it from source in Xcode; unlicensed | email + password | yes | yes, if you can build and sign an app | no | repo 2026-06-03 (single initial commit) |
| `huafetcher` | listed by Gadgetbridge; steps not verified | ? | yes | ? | no | not verified |
| Mi Fitness log grep / Xiaomi cloud token extractor | Xiaomi account + Android | Xiaomi | — | — | — | **not applicable**: those cover Xiaomi-ecosystem devices, not Zepp |

OpenCircuit deliberately does **not** log in to Zepp itself, even though that would make
onboarding easier (HelioCore shows it's possible). That keeps the promise that OpenCircuit
never talks to a vendor server (plan of record §3).
