# Zepp OS BLE protocol: Amazfit Helio Strap (living spec)

Facts-only specification of the Zepp OS ("Huami 2021") BLE protocol as used by the
**Amazfit Helio Strap**, written for a clean-room Swift implementation (#215). This is the
Phase-0 deliverable of the Helio plan: an implementer must be able to build the transport,
auth, session setup and history fetch **from this document alone**.

**Clean-room rules for this file.** It describes the protocol in prose, tables and byte
diagrams. It contains no code and no pseudo-code from the reference implementations, no
copied comments, and no identifiers except the protocol's own names (UUIDs, opcode values,
endpoint numbers). Every worked example was **constructed for this document** from made-up
keys and made-up readings; none is a capture or a fixture from another project.

Confidence legend (same as `PROTOCOL.md`): 🟢 confirmed on our own strap · 🟡 probable
(two sources agree, or one source that is known to work on the Helio) · 🔴 guess / single
source / inference. §10 is the checklist that promotes claims to 🟢. §10.1 records the first
run on Juan's strap (2026-09-30); the claims it confirmed are 🟢 with the source
`HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`, and everything else keeps its 🟡/🔴 tag.

HelioCore is the only reference known to run on a real Helio Strap from iOS; Gadgetbridge
covers the whole Zepp OS family and marks the Helio Strap *experimental*
(`GB/devices/huami/zeppos/straps/AmazfitHelioStrapCoordinator.java:33`). Where they
disagree, §9 says so.

## 1. Scope and device identification

| Fact | Tag | Source |
|---|---|---|
| The strap advertises the local name **`Amazfit Helio Strap`**, with no MAC suffix. | 🟡 | `GB/devices/huami/zeppos/straps/AmazfitHelioStrapCoordinator.java:39` |
| Zepp OS devices in general may append a 4-character suffix separated by a space or hyphen (`Amazfit Helio Strap 1A2B`, `…-1A2B`). Some devices advertise a second, hyphen-suffixed identity used only for calls. A matcher should accept the exact name, optionally followed by one or more of `-`/space and exactly four `[A-Z0-9]`. | 🟡 | `GB/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsCoordinator.java:99-117` |
| The **Helio Ring** advertises `Amazfit Helio Ring` and speaks the same protocol (same base class, no protocol overrides). Distinguish strap from ring by the name only. | 🟡 | `GB/devices/huami/zeppos/rings/AmazfitHelioRingCoordinator.java:37` |
| Other Zepp OS watches use other exact names (e.g. `Amazfit Balance`); none begins with `Amazfit Helio`. A prefix match on `Amazfit Helio Strap` is therefore sufficient to exclude them. | 🟡 | `GB/devices/huami/zeppos/watches/*Coordinator.java` |
| The strap has **no display** and Gadgetbridge declares it a fitness band. | 🟡 | `AmazfitHelioStrapCoordinator.java:53-55,69-71` |
| Manufacturer data / advertised service UUIDs: **not used by either reference; unknown.** | 🔴 | — (capture item §10) |
| HelioCore's scanner accepts any name containing `helio`, `amazfit` or `zepp` (case-insensitive). Too loose for OpenCircuit: it would also match watches. | 🟡 | `HC:1056` |
| A post-auth **device-info** request (§5.3) returns a flags word; for the Helio Strap Gadgetbridge records it as `0x7f`. It also returns a PnP ID from which a product id / version can be read at PnP bytes 3–4 and 5–6 (little-endian). | 🟡 | `SVC/DeviceInfo:95-101,158-160` |
| Gadgetbridge supports a Bluetooth-Classic transport for some Zepp OS watches. **Ignore it**: iOS is BLE-only, and the Helio uses the BLE path. | 🟡 | `GB/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsCoordinator.java:121-132` |

Firmware seen in the wild on Helio Straps: **3.11.0** and **3.11.0.1** (user reports,
Gadgetbridge issues #5986 opened 2026-04-08 and #5843 opened 2026-03-06). Juan's strap:
hardware revision **0.132.27.2** (DIS `0x2A27`); his Zepp account lists firmware **3.3.6.5**.
The strap has **no DIS firmware-revision characteristic** (`0x2A26`), so the firmware version
has not been read over BLE yet; endpoint `0x0043` (§5.3) is the remaining route. 🟢
`HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` for the hardware revision and the missing `0x2A26`.

## 2. GATT map

All Huami-specific UUIDs are 128-bit: `0000XXXX-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700`, written below
as `…XXXX`. Discover characteristics **by UUID across all services** rather than assuming
which service holds them (that is what HelioCore does, `HC:1101-1106`).

| UUID | Name here | Props needed | Direction / use | v1? | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| service `0xFEE0` | Huami main service | — | parent of the chunked and activity characteristics | yes | 🟡 `HS:28`, `BTLE:75` |
| `…0016` | **chunked-write** | write (HelioCore uses write-without-response) and notify | phone → device message chunks; device's *chunk acks* may arrive here as notifications | **yes** | 🟢 present `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; 🟡 `HS:57`, `SUP:1074-1075,1145-1156`, `HC:607,894-899` |
| `…0017` | **chunked-read** | notify, write | device → phone message chunks (notify); phone writes its *chunk acks* **to this same characteristic** | **yes** | 🟢 present `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; 🟡 `HS:58`, `BTLE:138`, `SUP:1158-1165` |
| `…0004` | **activity-control** | write, notify | history-fetch control (§6) | **yes** | 🟢 present and used for every fetch `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; 🟡 `HS:44`, `SUP:962,973`, `HC:609,944` |
| `…0005` | **activity-data** | notify | history-fetch data packets (§6) | **yes** | 🟢 present and used for every fetch `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; 🟡 `HS:45`, `SUP:963,1077-1078`, `HC:610` |
| `0x180D` / `0x2A37` | Heart Rate Measurement | notify | live HR (§7) | **yes** | 🟢 present `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; 🟡 `BTLE:72`, `SUP:1089-1090`, `HC:611` |
| `0x180A` | Device Information Service | read | firmware / hardware revision strings, PnP ID; a leading `V` on the firmware string is stripped by Gadgetbridge. **On the Helio only the hardware revision `0x2A27` is exposed: there is no firmware revision `0x2A26`** | recommended | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` for what the Helio exposes; 🟡 `BTLE:73,78-105` |
| `0x2A2B` | Current Time | write | time-set fallback when the time endpoint is absent (§5.1) | fallback | 🟢 present `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` (not written); 🟡 `BTLE:180-183` |
| `0x180F` / `0x2A19` | Battery Level | read/notify | HelioCore records the characteristic if discovered but never reads or subscribes to it; Gadgetbridge does not use it. **Present on the Helio.** | optional | 🟢 present `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; `HC:612,1106,1127` |
| `…0001` / `…0002` | raw sensor control / data | — | raw accelerometer stream; not needed | no | 🟡 `HS:37-38` |
| `…0023` / `…0024` | file transfer v3 | — | not needed | no | 🟡 `HS:63-64` |
| `00001530-…` service, `…1531`/`…1532` | firmware update | — | **never write** | no | 🟡 `HS:31-34` |

Before sending anything, **enable notifications on `…0017`** (Gadgetbridge does so first,
`BTLE:138`). Enable notifications on `…0004` and `…0005` before a history fetch (§6).

Of the characteristics HelioVerify looks for, Juan's strap exposed `…0016`, `…0017`, `…0004`,
`…0005`, `0x2A37`, `0x2A19`, `0x2A2B` and `0x2A27`; only `0x2A26` was missing. 🟢
`HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`. Not recorded in that run: which service each sits under,
their properties, and the write types `…0016`/`…0004` accept (§10 item 2).

## 3. Transport: the chunked ("Huami 2021") protocol

Every command/response except the activity characteristics and standard GATT
characteristics travels as a **message** addressed to a 16-bit **endpoint**, split into
**chunks** that are written to `…0016` (phone → device) or notified on `…0017`
(device → phone).

### 3.1 Chunk header

Byte diagram of one chunk. All multi-byte integers in this protocol are **little-endian**.

```
first chunk of a message (11-byte header):
 +------+-------+------+--------+-------+-----------------------+-----------------+----------
 | 0x03 | flags | 0x00 | handle | count | total length (u32 LE) | endpoint (u16 LE) | data...
 +------+-------+------+--------+-------+-----------------------+-----------------+----------
   [0]    [1]     [2]     [3]      [4]         [5..8]                 [9..10]        [11..]

every later chunk (5-byte header):
 +------+-------+------+--------+-------+----------
 | 0x03 | flags | 0x00 | handle | count | data...
 +------+-------+------+--------+-------+----------
```

| Field | Meaning | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|
| `[0]` = `0x03` | marks a chunk. The receiver ignores anything else on `…0017` except a chunk ack (§3.4). | 🟡 `ENC:136`, `DEC:69-72`, `SUP:1132-1141` |
| `[1]` flags | bit `0x01` **first** chunk · bit `0x02` **last** chunk · bit `0x04` **ack requested** (always set together with *last*) · bit `0x08` **encrypted** (set on *every* chunk of an encrypted message). A single-chunk message therefore has `0x07` (plain) or `0x0F` (encrypted). | 🟡 `ENC:115-135`, `DEC:73-77` |
| `[2]` | "extended header" byte. The phone always writes `0x00`; the receiver skips this byte. | 🟡 `ENC:138-141`, `DEC:79-81`, `SUP:161` (Zepp OS forces the extended form) |
| `[3]` handle | message id, **u8**, per direction. The phone increments its handle **before** each message, so the first message after (re)connect uses `0x01`; it wraps `0xFF → 0x00`. Every chunk of one message carries the same handle. Reset to 0 on every (re)connect/re-auth. | 🟡 `ENC:64,160-163`, `SUP:297-299` |
| `[4]` count | chunk index within the message, u8, starting at `0x00`. | 🟡 `ENC:68,156` |
| `[5..8]` total length | length of the **plaintext** payload in bytes, even for encrypted messages (the ciphertext is longer, §3.3). First chunk only. | 🟡 `ENC:125-128`, `DEC:90-99` |
| `[9..10]` endpoint | 16-bit endpoint number (§3.5 lists them). First chunk only. | 🟡 `ENC:129-130`, `DEC:101` |

### 3.2 Chunk size, MTU and reassembly

- **Max data per chunk** = (ATT MTU − 3) − header size, where header size is 11 for the
  first chunk and 5 for the rest. ATT MTU − 3 is capped at 512. 🟡
  `ENC:111`, `GB/service/btle/AbstractBTLEDeviceSupport.java:92-100`.
  On iOS, use `maximumWriteValueLength(for:)` as the "(MTU − 3)" term: it is what the OS
  actually negotiated. 🔴 (inference; do **not** hard-code 247 as HelioCore does, `HC:843`).
- Gadgetbridge starts every connection assuming MTU 23 (`BTLE:143`, `SUP:158`) and, after
  auth succeeds, requests MTU 247 if the user allows high MTU (`BTLE:191-195`). The device can
  also announce an MTU on endpoint `0x0015` (reply `02` + u16 LE value = MTU − 3,
  `SVC/Connection:49-53`). 🟡
- A chunk is "last" when the remaining payload fits in the current chunk's capacity.
- **Reassembly (device → phone)**: on a *first* chunk, read total length and endpoint and
  start a buffer. For an encrypted message the buffer must hold the *padded ciphertext*
  length, `pad16(total length + 8)` (§3.3). Append every chunk's data. On the *last* chunk,
  decrypt if flagged, **truncate to total length**, and dispatch by endpoint. 🟡 `DEC:89-141`.
- Gadgetbridge ignores chunks whose handle differs from the message being reassembled and
  does not check `count` for gaps or order (`DEC:82-88`). See §9 for why OpenCircuit should
  be stricter.

### 3.3 Encryption

Which endpoints are encrypted is decided per endpoint by the **services list** the device
returns after auth (§5.2); the auth endpoint itself is always plaintext. 🟡 `SVC/Services:62-90`,
`AUTH:57`.

For an encrypted message with plaintext payload `P` of length `L`:

1. Build `P ‖ S ‖ C ‖ Z`, where
   - `S` = the current **encrypted-sequence number** as u32 LE, then increment it by 1 for
     the next encrypted message (it is only consumed by encrypted messages);
   - `C` = **CRC-32** (IEEE 802.3 / zlib / `java.util.zip.CRC32`: reflected, polynomial
     `0xEDB88320`, init and xorout `0xFFFFFFFF`) computed over `P ‖ S`, stored as u32 LE;
   - `Z` = zero bytes to pad the total to a multiple of 16 (none if `L + 8` already is).
   🟡 `ENC:81-99`, `GB/util/CheckSums.java:102-106`
2. **Message key** = the 16-byte **session key** (§4.4) with **every byte XORed with the
   message's handle byte**. 🟡 `ENC:77-80`, `DEC:115-118`
3. Encrypt the padded buffer with **AES-128 in ECB mode, no padding** (each 16-byte block
   independently). No IV. 🟡 `CRY:45-57`, `ENC:101`
4. Chunk the ciphertext as in §3.2, with flag `0x08` on every chunk, and total length = `L`
   (the plaintext length), not the ciphertext length. 🟡 `ENC:116-128`

**Receiving**: decrypt the reassembled ciphertext with the same message-key rule, using the
*incoming* chunk's handle, then keep the first `L` bytes. Gadgetbridge does **not** check the
device's trailing sequence number or CRC (`DEC:106-126`). The device's trailer has the same
`S ‖ C` layout: on the Helio, encrypted replies on `0x000A` and `0x001A` decrypted and the CRC
in their trailer matched `CRC-32(P ‖ S)`. 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`. Still open: whether the device's sequence
numbers are its own or follow ours (§10 item 5).

The sequence number starts at the value derived during auth (§4.4) and is per connection.
Gadgetbridge resets it to 0 on reconnect before re-auth overwrites it (`ENC:160-163`).

### 3.4 Chunk-level acks

- When a device → phone message's last chunk has flag `0x04`, the phone acknowledges by
  **writing to `…0017`** (the chunked-*read* characteristic) the 5 bytes
  `04 00 <handle> 01 <count>` where `<handle>` and `<count>` are those of the last chunk
  received. 🟡 `SUP:1131-1137,1158-1165`, `DEC:59-65,87-88,143`
- The device may acknowledge phone → device messages with a notification on `…0016`
  starting `04`, handle at byte `[2]`, count at byte `[4]`. Gadgetbridge only logs it and
  does not wait for it (no flow control). 🟡 `SUP:1145-1156`
- HelioCore sends **no** chunk acks and still completes auth and fetch on a Helio. 🟡
  (`HC` has no ack path). Recommendation: send them as Gadgetbridge does.

### 3.5 Endpoints relevant to v1

| Endpoint | Name here | Default encrypted (before the services list overrides) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0000` | services list | no | 🟡 `SVC/Services:32,38` |
| `0x000A` | config (settings) | yes | 🟡 `SVC/Config:104,116` |
| `0x000F` | alarms (§12) | no | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:47,72` |
| `0x0015` | connection (MTU announce, ping/pong) | yes | 🟡 `SVC/Connection:30,38` |
| `0x0016` | steps (realtime) | no | 🟡 `SVC/Steps:34,45` |
| `0x0017` | user info | yes | 🟡 `SVC/UserInfo:45,51` |
| `0x0018` | vibration patterns (§13.1) | yes | 🟡 `SVC/VibrationPatterns:44,50` |
| `0x001A` | find device / find phone (§11) | yes | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:34,60` |
| `0x001D` | heart rate (realtime control) | no | 🟡 `SVC/HeartRate:36,59` |
| `0x001E` | notifications: **not used for the strap** (§13.3) | yes | 🟡 `SVC/Notification:59,98` |
| `0x0029` | battery | yes | 🟡 `SVC/Battery:32,38` |
| `0x0043` | device info | no | 🟡 `SVC/DeviceInfo:48,56` |
| `0x0047` | time | no | 🟡 `SVC/Time:39,49` |
| `0x004B` | activity-fetch control (chunked alternative to `…0004`) | yes | 🟡 `SVC/ActivityFetch:30,35` |
| `0x0082` | **authentication** | **never** | 🟡 `AUTH:47,57` |

(Endpoint numbers coincide numerically with some characteristic short UUIDs, e.g. `0x0016`,
`0x0017`. They are unrelated namespaces.)

The `0x000F`, `0x0018`, `0x001A` and `0x001E` rows were added by the device-controls addendum
(§11–§15). As with every row, the services list (§5.2) decides whether the endpoint exists on
the connected strap and whether it is encrypted.

**The Helio Strap's services list** (🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`): 28 endpoints, `*` = encrypted:
`0000 0081* 0015 0047 0029 0017* 0028 0043 000a* 0030* 000d 0048 0016 0022 0049 0032 0036*
001d 0031 0018* 0082 0025 004b 000c* 004d* 0019* 000f 001a*`. Every endpoint in the table
above is present except notifications `0x001E` (§13.3). Three of them differ from the default
column: connection `0x0015`, battery
`0x0029` and activity-fetch `0x004B` are **plaintext** on this strap. This is why the services
list, not the defaults, decides encryption (§5.2).

A **connection ping**: the device may send `03` on endpoint `0x0015`; answer `04` on the
same endpoint. 🟡 `SVC/Connection:54-58`

### 3.6 Worked example A: plaintext, multi-chunk (constructed)

The auth public-key message of §4 (52-byte payload, endpoint `0x0082`, handle `0x01`) at
MTU 23. Capacity: first chunk 20 − 11 = 9 bytes, later chunks 20 − 5 = 15 bytes, so
9 + 15 + 15 + 13 = 52 over four chunks. `OC-vec`

```
chunk 0 (20 B): 03 01 00 01 00 | 34 00 00 00 | 82 00 | 04 02 00 02 a1 e4 ad 02 c2
chunk 1 (20 B): 03 00 00 01 01 | a4 4e a2 41 52 96 2c 14 0e a0 63 c6 9b 2e 5c
chunk 2 (20 B): 03 00 00 01 02 | 07 00 00 00 cd 50 73 a0 6d 67 b7 8a 3b c5 f5
chunk 3 (18 B): 03 06 00 01 03 | 19 ab 85 fb 9c f5 85 5d c8 01 00 00 00
```

Flags: `01` first, `00` middle, `06` last + ack-requested. Total length `0x34` = 52.
The same message at MTU 247 is one 63-byte chunk starting `03 07 00 01 00 34 00 00 00 82 00`.

### 3.7 Worked example B: encrypted (constructed, made-up key)

Session key (from worked example C, §4.6): `8c 45 6e 06 23 92 2f ab 73 ce 01 a0 cd dd ee ff`.
Encrypted-sequence number currently `0x2933d231`. Message: a history-fetch start sent through
endpoint `0x004B` as the third message on the connection (handle `0x03`); payload (10 bytes,
§6.2) `01 01 ea 07 09 1e 0c 00 00 08`. `OC-vec`

| Step | Bytes |
|---|---|
| message key = session key XOR `0x03` | `8f 46 6d 05 20 91 2c a8 70 cd 02 a3 ce de ed fc` |

## 4. Authentication

### 4.1 Inputs

- **Auth key**: 16 bytes minted by Zepp's cloud when the strap is paired in the Zepp app
  (see `HELIO_KEY_EXTRACTION.md`). Users see it as 32 hex digits, sometimes with a `0x`
  prefix. Accept exactly: optional `0x`/`0X`, then 32 hex digits, surrounding whitespace
  trimmed; reject anything else. 🟡 `AUTH:160-178` (Gadgetbridge also falls back to a default
  key and to raw ASCII bytes for older devices; **do not replicate that**. A wrong key must
  be a visible error.)
- **Curve**: NIST **B-163 = sect163r2** (binary field GF(2¹⁶³), reduction polynomial
  x¹⁶³ + x⁷ + x⁶ + x³ + 1, a = 1, cofactor 2). **Not** sect163k1. 🟡 The parameters in
  `ECDH:56-60` are identical to tiny-ECDH-c's `NIST_B163` set (`TE ecdh.c:100-108`), and
  `OC-vec` confirms them against an independent implementation (base point on curve, order ×
  G = ∞). HelioCore's comment calls it sect163k1 (`HC:1429`) but its constants are also
  B-163's (`HC:1436-1438`).
- **Port tiny-ECDH-c** (Unlicense) for the curve maths: CryptoKit has no binary curves. Keep
  its attribution header.

### 4.2 Wire representation of keys (tiny-ECDH-c layout)

| Item | Size | Layout | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| private key | 24 bytes | a 192-bit little-endian integer (6 × u32 words, least-significant word first, each word LE) | 🟡 `ECDH:42,407-424`, `TE ecdh.h` |
| public key | 48 bytes | X (24 bytes) then Y (24 bytes), each a field element in the same LE layout. The top 29 bits of each 24-byte element are always zero. | 🟡 `ECDH:43,457-458` |
| shared secret | 48 bytes | the shared **point**, X then Y, same layout (not just X) | 🟡 `ECDH:464-500`, `AUTH:86` |

Private-key rules, as in tiny-ECDH-c (both references do the same): draw 24 random bytes; if
the highest set bit is below bit 81 (degree < 163/2), draw again; the effective scalar is the
value with **every bit from 162 upwards cleared** (in byte terms: byte 20 masked to its low 2
bits, bytes 21–23 zeroed). Apply the same clearing when computing the shared secret. 🟡
`ECDH:442-452,478-484`, `HC:1440-1452,1546`. Use `SecRandomCopyBytes`, not a
non-cryptographic RNG (Gadgetbridge uses `java.util.Random`, `AUTH:135`; don't copy that).

Reject a device public key that is the point at infinity or is not on the curve. 🟡
`ECDH:471-472`

### 4.3 Message sequence (endpoint `0x0082`, plaintext)

```

```

| Field | Detail | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|
| request `04 02 00 02` | command `04`; the three bytes `02 00 02` are fixed and unexplained | 🟡 `AUTH:141-146`, `HC:852` |
| reply byte `[0]` | `10` = "response" (any other value: ignore) | 🟡 `AUTH:67-70`, `HS:224` |
| reply byte `[1]` | echoes the command (`04` or `05`) | 🟡 `AUTH:72` |
| reply byte `[2]` | status: `01` success. On the `04` reply, anything else is a failure. On the `05` reply, `25` means **wrong auth key**; any other non-`01` value is an unspecified failure. | 🟡 `AUTH:74-77,112-119`, `HC:867,887-888` |
| `04` reply `[3..18]` | 16-byte device random | 🟡 `AUTH:84`, `HC:869` |
| `04` reply `[19..66]` | device public key, 48 bytes (§4.2) | 🟡 `AUTH:85`, `HC:870` |
| AES in `05` | **AES-128-ECB, no padding**, one 16-byte block each: first with the auth key, second with the **session key** | 🟡 `AUTH:98-104`, `CRY:45-50`, `HC:875-880` |

The success path of this sequence works on the Helio with the real key: the `04` exchange,
the `05` message built as above, and `10 05 01`. 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`. The wrong-key reply (`10 05 25`)
has not been tested yet (§10 item 3).

### 4.4 Deriving the session parameters

From the 48-byte shared secret `s` (§4.2 layout):

- **encrypted-sequence seed** = `s[0..3]` read as **u32 little-endian** (the low 32 bits of the
  shared point's X). 🟡 `AUTH:87`, `BLT:229-231`, `HC:872`
- **session key** = `s[8..23]` (16 bytes, the middle of X's encoding) XOR the auth key,
  byte for byte. 🟡 `AUTH:89-92`, `HC:873-874`. 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`: the strap's encrypted replies
  decrypt with it (§3.3). The strap also answered our encrypted requests, which carried the
  seed-derived sequence numbers; 🔴 whether it checks them.

Both are installed **as soon as the `04` reply is processed**, before the `05` message is
sent (the `05` message itself is plaintext). After `10 05 01`, every endpoint that the
services list marks as encrypted uses them (§3.3). 🟡 `AUTH:95`

On `10 05 25`, Gadgetbridge tells the user the key is wrong and disconnects (`AUTH:151-158`).
OpenCircuit should do the same and surface a "key rejected: re-extract it" state (the key is
invalidated by unpairing in Zepp or a hard reset, see `HELIO_KEY_EXTRACTION.md`).

### 4.5 Timing notes

HelioCore waits ~0.4 s after enabling notifications before sending the public key
(`HC:846`). 🔴 whether the delay is needed; waiting for the notify-enabled callback should
suffice.

### 4.6 Worked example C: full handshake (constructed, made-up keys)

Made-up inputs (**not** a real strap or a real key). `OC-vec`

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| phone private key (as drawn) | `01 02 03 … 18` (bytes `0x01`…`0x18`) |
| phone effective scalar (bits ≥ 162 cleared) | `01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 14 01 00 00 00` |
| strap private key (simulated) | bytes `0x81`…`0x98`, effective `81 82 … 94 01 00 00 00` |
| auth key | `00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 aa bb cc dd ee ff` |
| strap random | `f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 fa fb fc fd fe ff` |

Outputs:

```
phonePub X = a1 e4 ad 02 c2 a4 4e a2 41 52 96 2c 14 0e a0 63 c6 9b 2e 5c 07 00 00 00
phonePub Y = cd 50 73 a0 6d 67 b7 8a 3b c5 f5 19 ab 85 fb 9c f5 85 5d c8 01 00 00 00

(shared is identical whichever side computes it)

encSeq seed      = 0x2933d231            (shared[0..3] = 31 d2 33 29, LE)
session key      = 8c 45 6e 06 23 92 2f ab 73 ce 01 a0 cd dd ee ff
AES(auth, rnd)   = e8 55 41 bb 23 2f 07 09 90 89 75 3d 86 c0 dd f0
AES(sess, rnd)   = e0 f4 c3 cc 1c 86 76 7b dd 16 70 a2 1d 60 d5 4f
```

Strap's `04` reply payload (67 bytes):
`10 04 01 f0 f1 … ff` then strapPub X, then strapPub Y.

Phone's `05` message (33 bytes, handle 2), as one chunk at MTU 247:
`03 07 00 02 00 21 00 00 00 82 00 05 e8 55 41 bb 23 2f 07 09 90 89 75 3d 86 c0 dd f0 e0 f4 c3 cc 1c 86 76 7b dd 16 70 a2 1d 60 d5 4f`.

These vectors are suitable as unit-test fixtures for the Swift port (they are ours, not
copied from any project).

## 5. Post-auth session setup

Gadgetbridge's order after `10 05 01` (🟡 `SUP:901-957`, `BTLE:191-195`):

1. request MTU 247 (iOS: nothing to do, the OS negotiates);
2. request the **services list** (§5.2);
3. on the reply: set the time (§5.1), request device info (§5.3), then initialise each
   supported service (battery request, config capabilities, user info, realtime-steps off…);
4. history fetch is started separately (by the user or a schedule).

HelioCore's minimal path skips 1–3 entirely: auth, then fetch over `…0004`/`…0005` with
plaintext writes, and it works on a Helio (🟡 `HC:886-892,902-930`). **Recommended v1
order**: auth → services list → time set → battery → read HEALTH config (§5.5) → fetch. Time
set matters most: once the Zepp app is gone, **nothing else sets the strap's clock**, and
every history timestamp is in the strap's clock (§6.4).

### 5.1 Time (endpoint `0x0047`, plaintext by default)

Use it if the services list contains `0x0047`, otherwise write the same 11 time bytes to
the standard Current Time characteristic `0x2A2B`. 🟡 `SUP:934-940`, `BTLE:180-183`

**Set time** = `05` followed by 11 bytes (12 bytes total): 🟡 `SVC/Time:80-89`,
`GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiUtils.java:152-182`

| Offset (after `05`) | Size | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u16 LE | year |
| 2 | u8 | month 1–12 |
| 3 | u8 | day of month |
| 4 | u8 | hour 0–23 (local) |
| 5 | u8 | minute |
| 6 | u8 | second |
| 7 | u8 | day of week, **Sunday = 0 … Saturday = 6** (not the GATT convention) |
| 8 | u8 | fraction of second in 1/256 |
| 9 | u8 | `08` if daylight-saving time is currently in effect, else `00` |
| 10 | i8 | current UTC offset **including DST**, in quarter-hours (UTC+2 → `08`, UTC−5 → `ec`) |

Reply: `06 <status>` (status `01` observed). The device rejects the 10-byte GATT form with
"out of range". 🟡 `SVC/Time:64-66`, `HuamiUtils.java:153-157`

**Next DST transition** = `07`, then u32 LE Unix seconds of the next transition, then
**i16** LE the offset change in seconds (e.g. `+3600` spring forward, `−3600` fall back).
Skip it if the zone has no future transition. Reply `08 <status>`. 🟡 `SVC/Time:91-114`

Example (constructed): 2026-09-30 12:34:56.000, a Wednesday, Europe/Madrid (UTC+2, DST on)
→ `05 ea 07 09 1e 0c 22 38 03 00 08 08`.

### 5.2 Services list (endpoint `0x0000`, plaintext)

Request `03`. Reply: `04`, u16 LE count, then count × (u16 LE endpoint, u8 encrypted flag
`00`/`01`; other flag values = leave the default). 🟡 `SVC/Services:58-90`. Use it to
(a) know which endpoints exist (e.g. whether `0x004B` and `0x0047` are available), and
(b) override each endpoint's encryption flag from §3.5. 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`: request, reply layout
and flags as described; the Helio's list is in §3.5.

### 5.3 Device info and battery

- **Device info** (endpoint `0x0043`, plaintext): request `01`. Reply `02 01`, then u64 LE
  flags, then fields present by flag bit: bit0 = a length-prefixed blob (skip), bit1 =
  serial number (NUL-terminated UTF-8), bit2 = hardware version (NUL-terminated), bit3 =
  firmware version (NUL-terminated), bit4 = 7-byte PnP ID. If the services list lacks
  `0x0043`, read DIS `0x180A`. 🟡 `SVC/DeviceInfo:77-141`. The serial number is a personal
  identifier: never log it or commit it.
- **Battery** (endpoint `0x0029`, encrypted by default): request `03`. Reply `04` + 20 bytes
  (21 total). Payload byte `[2]` = level in %, byte `[3]` = `00` not charging / `01`
  charging; bytes `[11..18]` hold a last-charge date (u16 year, month, day, h, m, s, i8
  quarter-hour offset) and `[20]` the last charge level. 🟡 `SVC/Battery:47-70`, `GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiBatteryInfo.java:60-103`
  (offsets given here relative to the full reply, i.e. Gadgetbridge's offsets + 1).

### 5.4 User info (endpoint `0x0017`, encrypted by default), optional

Gadgetbridge sends it on every connect if the user profile is complete. 🟡
`SVC/UserInfo:93-146`. Probably feeds on-device calorie/PAI maths; 🔴 whether the strap
records anything differently without it. Layout:

`01` · `4f 07 00 00` (fixed) · u16 LE birth year · u8 month · u8 day · u8 gender (`00` male,
`01` female, `02` other) · u16 LE height cm · u16 LE weight in **kg × 200** · u64 LE user id
(any stable number) · region as UTF-8 then `00` · `09` (fixed, unexplained) · display name as
UTF-8 then `00`. Reply `02 <status>`.

### 5.5 Settings that decide what is RECORDED (config endpoint `0x000A`, encrypted by default)

The strap only records a metric if its monitoring setting is on. The Zepp app sets them;
**read them after auth** and warn the user when one is off, rather than silently fetching
nothing.

**Commands** 🟡 `SVC/Config:104-111,283-388,938-960`

| Command | Bytes |
|---|---|
| capabilities | send `01` → reply `02`, u8 service version (≤ 3 understood), u8 group count, group ids… |
| read | send `03`, u8 include-constraints (`01`/`00`), u8 group, u8 arg count, arg codes… (arg count `00` asks for all args, 🔴) |
| read reply | `04`, u8 status (`01` ok), u8 group, u8 group version, u8 includes-constraints, u8 entry count, then entries |
| write | send `05`, u8 group, u8 group version, `00`, u8 entry count, then entries (value only, no constraints). **One message per group.** |
| write ack | `06`, u8 status |

**Entry** = u8 arg code, u8 type, value. Value encodings (LE throughout): 🟡
`SVC/Config:432-444`, `GB/service/devices/huami/zeppos/services/config/*.java`

| Type | Code | Value | Extra bytes when constraints are included |
|---|---|---|---|
| bool | `0x0b` | 1 byte, `00`/`01` (anything else: stop parsing) | none |
| byte | `0x10` | 1 byte | u8 n, then n allowed values |
| byte list | `0x11` | u8 n, n bytes | u8 m, then m allowed values |
| short | `0x01` | i16 | i16 min, i16 max |
| short list | `0x02` | u8 n, n × i16 | u8 min count, u8 max count, i16 min, i16 max |
| int | `0x03` | i32 | i32 min, i32 max |
| string | `0x20` | UTF-8 up to `00` | u8 max length |
| string list | `0x21` | UTF-8 up to `00` | u8 max length, u8 n, n NUL-terminated strings |
| hh:mm | `0x30` | u8 hour, u8 minute | none |
| timestamp | `0x40` | i64 ms | none |
| int (unbounded) | `0x50` | i32 | none |

An unknown type code makes the rest of the reply unparseable (no length field): keep what
was parsed and stop. 🟡 `SVC/Config:1025-1032`

**HEALTH group = `0x08`** (Gadgetbridge understands versions 1–3 and writes version `03`).
🟡 `SVC/Config:399,516-539`

On the Helio, capabilities reply with service version **3** and groups `00 0b 08 09 0a`, and
the HEALTH group `0x08` reads back as group version **3**. 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` (read only; nothing was
written).

| Arg | Type | Meaning | Relevant fetch type(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | byte | all-day HR monitoring: `00` off, `ff` "smart"/auto, `N` = every N minutes (Gadgetbridge caps at 120) | activity HR, resting/max HR, HRV 🔴 | 
| `0x04` | bool | HR monitoring during activity | activity HR 🔴 |
| `0x05` | bool | share HR with third parties. 🔴 Probably the Zepp app's **"Heart Rate Push"** switch (Zepp › Device › Helio Strap › Health Monitoring), which the strap needs for standard-HR broadcast (§7) | live HR |
| `0x11` | bool | high-accuracy sleep monitoring (uses HR for sleep; needed for REM staging 🔴) | sleep session |
| `0x12` | bool | sleep breathing-quality monitoring. Gadgetbridge notes it is required for **sleep SpO₂** (`FOP/Spo2Sleep:31-33`); 🔴 likely also for sleep respiratory rate | `0x26`, `0x38` 🔴 |
| `0x13` | bool | stress monitoring | `0x13` 🟡 |
| `0x31` | bool | all-day SpO₂ monitoring | automatic `0x25` 🟡 |
| `0x02` / `0x03` / `0x32` | byte | high-HR / low-HR / low-SpO₂ alert thresholds | — |

HR-interval encoding 🟡 `SVC/Config:1508-1523`. Gadgetbridge v0.90 reportedly **hides** the
HR-interval setting for the Helio Strap because its HR is always on (third-hand, from its
release notes; 🔴). **Temperature** has no known switch in any reference: 🔴 assume it is
always recorded.

Example (constructed): enable stress monitoring → payload `05 08 03 00 01 13 0b 01`.

## 6. History fetch

### 6.1 Channels

| Role | Path A (legacy characteristic) | Path B (chunked endpoint) |
|---|---|---|
| control out (phone → strap) | write to `…0004` (plaintext) | message on endpoint `0x004B` (encrypted per services list) |
| control in (strap → phone) | notification on `…0004` | message on endpoint `0x004B` |
| data | notifications on `…0005` (plaintext) | **same**: notifications on `…0005` |

Gadgetbridge uses Path B whenever the services list includes `0x004B`, else Path A
(`SUP:968-976`, `SVC/ActivityFetch:44-52`). HelioCore uses Path A on the Helio and it works
(`HC:902-946`). Control messages have **identical bytes** on both paths. 🟡. Recommendation:
Path A first (simplest, proven on the Helio); Path B only if Path A is refused. 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`:
Path A (plaintext writes to `…0004`) carried every fetch of §10.1, even though the Helio also
lists `0x004B` (plaintext there, §3.5). Path B is untested.

Notifications: enable `…0004` before the first command; enable `…0005` before sending the
"fetch data" command; Gadgetbridge disables both when the whole batch is done
(`GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiFetcher.java:170-202`, `FETCH:219`). 🟡

### 6.2 One fetch round

```
Phone                                                          Strap

```

| Message | Layout | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|
| **start** | `01`, u8 fetch type (§6.5), then the 8-byte **since** timestamp: u16 LE year, month, day, hour, minute (local), u8 second, i8 UTC offset **including DST** in quarter-hours. Gadgetbridge sends second = `00` by default (minute precision; seconds broke the GTR 3). | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` (second `00`); 🟡 `FETCH:145-151`, `SUP:679-688`, `BLT:121-134,380-387`, `GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiFetcher.java:150-156`, `HC:926-928,1258-1266` |
| **start reply** | `10 01 <status>`; status `01` = ok, else the type is unsupported/refused: skip it. Then u32 LE **expected length**, then the 8-byte **start** timestamp of the first record, same format as *since*. Gadgetbridge accepts 15 or 16 bytes (a 16th byte, `00`, was seen on another Zepp OS band); **the Helio sent the 16-byte form** (trailing `00`) every time. **The length's unit depends on the type**: 8-byte **records** for activity, **bytes** for every other type seen on hardware (§6.5 "Length unit"). Either way it excludes the per-packet counter bytes. | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` (16 B, the per-type unit); 🟡 `FETCH:153-221` |
| **empty start reply** | status `01` with **length 0** means the strap has nothing for this type since *since*, **whatever the start timestamp holds**: don't validate it. Two forms seen: a far-future **sentinel** start (e.g. `3a 08 02 06 02 1c 10 f0` = 2106-02-06 02:28:16 at UTC−4, which is 2³² − 86 400 Unix seconds) for a type with nothing in the window, and an **all-zero** start (8 × `00`, not a valid date) on the follow-up round straight after a round that delivered data. Both are then acked like any empty round. | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` (both forms; 🔴 what the sentinel's value means) |
| **fetch data** | the single byte `02` | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; 🟡 `FETCH:220`, `HC:944` |
| **data packet** | on `…0005`: byte `[0]` = u8 **packet counter** starting at `00` for each round and incrementing by 1 (wrapping); the rest is data. Concatenate the data parts. A packet can be much longer than 20 bytes (a 241-byte packet was seen at the Mac's MTU). | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; 🟡 `FETCH:123-143`, `HC:955-965` |
| **transfer done** | `10 02 <status>`; status `01` = ok. 7-byte form carries u32 LE **CRC-32** (same CRC as §3.3) of the concatenated data parts, counters excluded. | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`: 7-byte form, and the CRC matched for every type except activity, where it is **unknown** (§6.5); 🟡 `FETCH:223-246` |
| **ack** | `03`, then ack mode (§6.3) | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` (`03 09` only); 🟡 `FETCH:260-277` |
| **ack reply** | `10 03 …`; Gadgetbridge treats it as "round finished" and only then starts the next round/type | 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)` (`10 03 01` after every ack, including empty rounds); 🟡 `FETCH:173-176` |

Worked example D (constructed, made-up readings): fetch HRV since 2026-09-29 00:00 in UTC+2.
`OC-vec`

```
→ 01 49 ea 07 09 1d 00 00 00 08
← 10 01 01 0c 00 00 00 ea 07 09 1d 00 05 00 08      len = 12, first record 00:05:00 (+02:00)

← 10 02 01 39 62 bb d7                               CRC-32 of the 12 data bytes = 0xd7bb6239

```

The two records decode (§6.5) to 42 ms at 1790633100 (2026-09-28T22:05:00Z) and 57 ms at
1790633400 (22:10:00Z).

**Trace T1** (a hardware trace, not a constructed example; control bytes and lengths only, `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`): a 30-minute activity
window at UTC−4. The length field counts **records**: 30 minutes × 8 bytes = 240 data bytes.

```
→ 01 01 ea 07 09 1e 0b 37 00 f0                     since 2026-09-30 11:55 (−04:00)
← 10 01 01 1e 00 00 00 ea 07 09 1e 0b 37 00 f0 00   length 30 (records); start = since; 16 B

← […0005] 00 + 240 data bytes                        one 241-byte packet
→ 03 09                                              ZeppKit before the fix: "overflow", acked at once
← 10 02 01 <crc32>                                   transfer done, 7-byte form, after our ack
← 10 03 01
```

A correct phone waits for the transfer done, checks 240 = 30 × 8 bytes and the CRC, then
acks. A 12-hour activity window announced `720` (720 minutes, so 5760 data bytes are
expected; that round was also aborted early, at 960 bytes, so the full size is not yet seen).

### 6.3 Ack: keep vs delete (critical)

| Ack mode byte | Meaning | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|
| `01` | "saved on the phone": the strap marks the data as synced and **stops offering it**; Gadgetbridge notes the detailed data then appears to be discarded and is never re-sent | 🟡 `FETCH:266-270` |
| `09` | acknowledged **but kept** marked as unsynced on the strap (non-destructive) | 🟡 `FETCH:266-270`, `HC:969,986` |

Gadgetbridge's rules on Zepp OS (🟡 `FETCH:204-209,236-258`):

- expected length 0 → send `03 09` and wait for the ack reply;
- CRC present and wrong → send `03 09` (keep);
- processing failed, or packet-counter gap (the round is marked invalid) → `03 09`;
- otherwise `03 01`, unless the user chose "keep data on device" → `03 09`.

**OpenCircuit rule**: send `03 09` during development (so Zepp/Gadgetbridge can pull the same
window for side-by-side validation) and, in production, send `03 01` **only after the parsed
round is durably committed** to the local store (mirroring `HistoryCommitGate`). Any failure
path → `03 09`.

Unknowns (🔴, §10): whether `01` frees strap storage immediately; how long the strap retains
unsynced data when only `09` is ever sent (it may eventually overwrite the oldest).

Answered on the Helio (🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`):

- A later fetch whose *since* overlaps data already acked with `09` **re-delivers** it
  (temperature).
- A `03 09` sent **mid-transfer** (before the strap's transfer done) is tolerated: the strap
  still sent its transfer done and `10 03 01`, and the next type fetched normally. The phone
  must therefore ignore a late `10 02` after it has acked.

### 6.4 Rounds, cursors and timestamps

- The strap returns at most a limited window per round. After processing a round, set the
  next *since* to the **last record's time + 1 minute** and start another round of the same
  type while: the round advanced by ≥ 1 s, fewer than ~11 rounds have run, and the new
  *since* is not in the future. 🟡 `REPEAT:64-114`. HelioCore does the same with ≤ 20 rounds
  (`HC:973-981`).
- First-ever cursor: Gadgetbridge starts 100 days back (`FETCH:293-303`). Keep one cursor
  **per fetch type**.
- **Per-minute types** (activity, stress-auto, temperature) carry no timestamps: record *i*
  is at `start + i minutes`, where *start* comes from the start reply. On the Helio, their
  *start* equalled the requested *since*; for event types it was the first record's own time.
  🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`. Interpret the start
  reply's local fields **with its own quarter-hour offset byte**: absolute instant = local
  fields − offset × 15 min. 🟡 `BLT:161-184`, `FOP/Activity:112-121`. (HelioCore ignores the
  offset byte and uses the phone's zone, `HC:1268-1285`. Wrong whenever the strap's zone
  differs from the phone's, e.g. after travel or a DST change before a time set.)
- **Records with their own timestamp** use a u32 LE **Unix epoch seconds (UTC)** value, often
  followed by an i8 UTC offset in quarter-hours for local display. 🟡 (per type below)

### 6.5 Fetch types

"GB maps to" is where Gadgetbridge stores the value. "Helio" says whether Gadgetbridge
schedules the fetch for the Helio Strap: it queues a type when the coordinator reports
support, and the strap inherits all Zepp OS defaults except display-dependent ones
(`GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiFetcher.java:54-112`,
`GB/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsCoordinator.java:173-249,611-617`).

| Code | Name | Record layout (LE) | Rate / timestamps | Units / scaling | GB maps to | Helio in GB | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | **activity** | **8 bytes/min** on Zepp OS: `[0]` kind, `[1]` intensity, `[2]` steps, `[3]` HR, `[4]` unknown, `[5]` sleep, `[6]` deep-sleep, `[7]` REM (sleep bytes: use low 7 bits) | 1/min from *start* | steps = count in that minute; HR bpm, `ff` or `00` = no reading (HelioCore drops them; GB stores raw); intensity 0–255 (GB divides by 256). CRC is **not** checked by GB for this type; 🔴 whether it matches on the Helio (no hardware activity round has reached the check yet). | per-minute activity sample | yes (always) | 🟢 8 bytes/min, length in records `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; fields 🟡 `FOP/Activity:71-164`, `SUP:984-986`, `HC:1180-1193` |

Other versions: reject. | event | % | SpO₂ sample, type auto/manual | yes | 🟢 version `02` + 65-byte records, CRC `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; fields 🟡 `FOP/Spo2Normal:64-103`, `HC:1201-1212` |

| `0x2e` | **temperature** | 8 bytes/min: i16 unknown (`0x7fff` observed), **i16 temperature**, i16 unknown, i16 unknown (`0x5a5a` observed in both) | 1/min from *start* | **centi-°C** (÷100), skin at the wrist/arm | skin temperature | yes (no display) | 🟢 8 bytes/min, CRC `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; fields 🟡 `FOP/Temperature:61-96`, `HC:1168-1178` |
| `0x38` | **sleep respiratory rate** | 8 bytes: u32 ts, i8 tz, u8 rate, u8 unknown (`00`), u8 unknown (`01`, sometimes `02`/`04` near waking) | during sleep | breaths/min | resp-rate sample | yes | 🟢 8-byte records, CRC `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; fields 🟡 `FOP/SleepRespiratoryRate:62-90`, `HC:1225-1233` |
| `0x3a` | **resting HR** | 6 bytes: u32 ts, i8 tz, u8 bpm | ~daily (Zepp shows it per day) | bpm | resting-HR sample | yes | 🟢 6-byte record, CRC `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; fields 🟡 `FOP/HeartRateResting:63-91`, `HC:1214-1222` |

| `0x48` | **sleep session** | **594-byte** records, see §6.6 | per night | minutes | sleep-session blob; stages overlaid on activity | yes | 🟢 594-byte record, CRC `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`; fields 🟡 `FOP/SleepSession:59-85` |

| `0x07` | debug logs | — | — | — | — | no | 🟡 `GB/…/fetch/HuamiFetchDataType.java:24` |

**Length unit of the start reply** (§6.2). The announced length counts **8-byte records
(minutes) for activity** and **bytes for every other type seen on hardware**: temperature
(`0x2e`), stress-auto (`0x13`, 1 byte per minute, so the two units coincide there), HRV
(`0x49`), SpO₂ (`0x25`), resting HR (`0x3a`), sleep respiratory rate (`0x38`), sleep session
(`0x48`), PAI (`0x0d`) and sleep SpO₂ (`0x26`). 🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`. Manual HR (`0x02`), manual stress
(`0x12`) and max HR (`0x3d`) have only answered "empty" so far: **bytes 🟡**. Activity proved
that the unit can differ by type, so confirm each of these the first time it delivers data.
Convert to bytes before the checks below: expected data bytes = length × 8 for activity,
= length otherwise. Then an overflow, a length mismatch at transfer done, or a CRC mismatch
rejects the round (ack `09`).

Length rules to enforce before parsing (a violation = reject the round, ack `09`), in bytes:
activity multiple of 8; stress-auto any; manual/max/resting HR and HRV multiple of 6; temperature
and resp-rate multiple of 8; SpO₂ (length − 1) multiple of 65; sleep SpO₂ (length − 1)
multiple of 30; sleep session multiple of 594; PAI multiple of 102; manual stress multiple
of 5. 🟡 (the per-type sources above)

**Activity `kind` byte** (Zepp OS table, 🟡 `GB/devices/huami/HuamiExtendedSampleProvider.java:35-42,151-170`):
`0x40` (64) outdoor running · `0x73` (115) not worn · `0x76` (118) charging · `0x78` (120)
sleep. All other values are unmapped in Gadgetbridge and shown as generic activity; only
"walking" is named for the Helio (issue #5843, 2026-03-06). 🔴 full table.

**Sleep staging without a session record**: when no `0x48` session covers a minute,
Gadgetbridge falls back to thresholds on the activity record's REM/deep bytes (REM if REM > 55,
else deep if deep > 42, else light), which it calls arbitrary (`HuamiExtendedSampleProvider.java:127-147`).
🔴 Prefer the session record; otherwise feed per-minute HR/motion into OpenCircuit's own
`SleepStaging`.

### 6.6 Sleep session record (`0x48`), 594 bytes

🟡 `GB/devices/huami/HuamiSleepSessionSampleProvider.java:70-195`

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x000` | u32 | session timestamp (Unix s) |
| `0x004` | u32 | "midnight" reference: local midnight (as Unix s) of the day the session belongs to |
| `0x008`, `0x009` | u8, u8 | both `01` in observed data, unexplained |
| `0x00A` | u16 | sleep start, minutes |
| `0x00C` | u16 | sleep end, minutes |
| `0x015` | u8 | average HR during sleep, bpm |
| `0x016` | u8 | sleep score |
| `0x054` | u8 | number of stages *n* (0 = no staging; skip the record) |
| `0x056` + 5·*i* | u16, u16, u8 | stage *i*: start minute, end minute, stage type |
| `0x24A` | u16 | total REM, minutes |
| `0x24C` | u16 | total light, minutes |
| `0x24E` | u16 | total deep, minutes |
| `0x250` | u16 | total awake, minutes |

**Minute fields** are minutes counted from `midnight − 24 h` (the previous local midnight):
absolute = `midnight − 86400 + minutes × 60`. The source comments call the base "noon of
the previous day", but the arithmetic uses midnight − 24 h; 🔴 until a capture decides.
**Stage types**: `04` light · `05` deep · `07` awake · `08` REM · anything else = generic
sleep. The stage table fits at most 100 entries before `0x24A` (🔴 inference). Gadgetbridge
uses each stage's start and the session end, ignoring stage end fields (🟡); OpenCircuit
should use both and flag gaps.

## 7. Live data

### 7.1 Standard heart rate (`0x180D` / `0x2A37`)

- **With auth** (Gadgetbridge's path): enable notify on `0x2A37`, then send `04 01` (start) on
  endpoint `0x001D`, then `04 02` ("continue") **every second** to keep it running; `04 00`
  stops it. Reply `05 <status>` (`00` observed as success). 🟡 `SVC/HeartRate:36-47,112-183`.
  🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`: after auth, this start plus the 1 s `04 02` gave **one `0x2A37` notification per
  second**. (The `05` reply's status was not recorded.)
- The same endpoint pushes **sleep events**: `06 01` fell asleep, `06 00` woke up. 🟡
  `SVC/HeartRate:74-88` (useful as a sleep-window hint).
- **Without auth (Tier 0)**: Amazfit documents a **"Heart Rate Push"** switch (Zepp › Device ›
  Amazfit Helio Strap › Health Monitoring) that makes the strap serve HR to third-party
  devices over "the standard Bluetooth protocol" (support.amazfit.com, "How to set the heart
  rate push function?", © 2025, fetched 2026-09-30). HelioCore finds `0x2A37` and has a parser for it but never enables notifications on it
  (`HC:618,1105,1125`), so it is no evidence either way. 🔴 whether an
  **unauthenticated** central gets `0x2A37` notifications with Heart Rate Push on (§10).
- Parse `0x2A37` per the Bluetooth HRS spec: flags bit0 → u8/u16 HR; bit3 energy expended
  present; bit4 RR intervals present (u16, 1/1024 s). Gadgetbridge only accepts the
  2-byte u8 form (`SVC/HeartRate:158-167`); HelioCore only the u8 form (`HC:1247-1252`).
  🔴 whether the Helio ever sends RR intervals.

### 7.2 Realtime steps (endpoint `0x0016`)

`05 01`/`05 00` enable/disable (ack `06 <status> <enabled>`); notifications `07` + 13 bytes,
steps = u16 LE at offset 1 of those 13. Gadgetbridge turns it **off** on connect because the
setting persists across connections. 🟡 `SVC/Steps:36-110`. Not needed for v1.

### 7.3 Battery

Use the battery endpoint (§5.3). `0x2A19` only if discovery shows it exists. 🔴

---

## 8. What Gadgetbridge marks unsupported / experimental for the Helio Strap

- The whole device is flagged **experimental** (`AmazfitHelioStrapCoordinator.java:33`).
- Device "sources" (firmware-matching ids) are an explicit **TODO/empty**
  (`AmazfitHelioStrapCoordinator.java:43-45`): firmware updates through Gadgetbridge are not
  supported.
- **Manual HR measurement** is disabled for all Zepp OS devices ("sometimes never finishes",
  `ZeppOsCoordinator.java:178-180`).
- **Sleep SpO₂ (`0x26`)** is parsed but never stored nor scheduled (§6.5).
- **Activity types** beyond walking are unmapped (issue #5843, open, 2026-03-06).
- **Workout HR** is persisted at 1/min only; the strap records ~1 Hz during workouts
  (issue #5617, open, opened 2025-12-14; maintainer: "can be implemented, but needs some work").
- **VO₂ max** only comes from workouts, which are hard to start on a screenless strap
  (issue #5986, 2026-04-08). The same thread reports that HRV/SpO₂/PAI/sleep stages were
  missing on the first Gadgetbridge syncs and appeared on later syncs; the maintainer's
  explanation was that data the official app had already synced is not re-offered. This is
  consistent with ack `01` semantics (§6.3).
- Live-activity and speed-zone screens, sedentary reminders: broken or unsupported (issue
  #5799, 2026-02-15). Not relevant to OpenCircuit.

Other defensive points:

- **Handle interleaving**: Gadgetbridge drops chunks whose handle differs from the message in
  progress, so a lost *last* chunk stalls reassembly until something resets it. On a new
  *first* chunk, discard any incomplete message and start over. 🔴 (recommendation)
- **Re-auth resets everything**: new handle counter (0), new session key, new sequence seed;
  never reuse them across connections (`SUP:297-299`). Gadgetbridge notes that initialising
  twice changes the session key mid-flight and breaks decryption (`SUP:909-913`).
- **Config writes** carry Gadgetbridge's own group version (HEALTH `03`), not necessarily the
  version the device reported (`SVC/Config:944-947`). 🔴 whether a v1/v2 device accepts that;
  prefer echoing the version from the read reply.
- **Start-reply length**: accept 15 or 16 bytes (`FETCH:190-195`; Gadgetbridge's check
  effectively accepts any 16th byte); treat other lengths as a failed round. The Helio sends
  16 (🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`).
- **Empty start replies**: length 0 ends the type for this fetch whatever the start timestamp
  says; an all-zero start is normal there, not a malformed reply (🟢 `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`, §6.2). Validating
  that timestamp turns every "nothing more" into a bogus failure and a retry.
- **Per-type length unit**: never assume the start reply's length is in bytes. Activity counts
  records (§6.5); an implementation that assumes bytes rejects every activity round.
- **Competing central**: while the Zepp app is installed and running, it reconnects to the
  strap and may win the connection. Auth failures other than `25` right after connect may
  mean another central holds the strap. 🔴 (plan-of-record §7; no protocol-level signal
  known).
- **Timestamps you can't trust**: after a battery drain the strap clock may be wrong until the
  time is set; drop records dated in the future or before the strap's first sync.
- **Temperature sentinels**: the first and last two i16 fields hold constants; 🔴 whether the
  temperature field itself ever holds a "no reading" value (treat `0x7fff`/`0x8000` and
  anything outside ~20–45 °C as missing; HelioCore filters 20–45 for display, `HC:1007-1008`).

## 10. Promote to 🟢: capture checklist (Juan's strap)

Record firmware (DIS `0x2A26` or endpoint `0x0043`) with every run. The Helio has no
`0x2A26` (§10.1), so use `0x0043`. Keep captures in
`desktop/captures/` (gitignored); commit findings only. Use `03 09` (keep) for every ack.

1. **Advertisement**: name exactly as broadcast (suffix or not); manufacturer data bytes;
   advertised service UUIDs; whether a second hyphen-suffixed identity appears.
2. **GATT dump**: every service and characteristic with properties; confirm `…0016`,
   `…0017`, `…0004`, `…0005` sit under `0xFEE0`; whether `0x180F/0x2A19` exists; the write
   types `…0016` and `…0004` accept.
3. **Auth** against the real key: `10 04 01` reply length is 67; `10 05 01` success; then a
   deliberately wrong key returns `10 05 25`. Promotes §4.
4. **Services list**: full endpoint table with encryption flags (is `0x004B` present? which
   are encrypted?). Promotes §3.5.
5. **One encrypted round-trip** (battery on `0x0029`): decrypts; check whether the device's
   trailer is `seq ‖ CRC` and whether its sequence numbers are its own or follow ours.
   Promotes §3.3.
6. **Chunk acks**: does the strap set `0x04` on its last chunk; does it notify acks on
   `…0016`; does anything break if the phone never acks.
7. **Time set** via `0x0047` (reply `06 01`), then read back through a fetch start reply.
8. **HEALTH config read**: record the group version and every arg value; confirm arg `0x05`
   toggles with Zepp's "Heart Rate Push".
9. **Fetch each type** in §6.5 over Path A for a 24 h window: record length rules, versions,
   first-record time vs *since*, and compare values against Gadgetbridge (or Zepp) for the
   same window. Specifically: HRV unknown byte (tz?), HRV statistic (compare to Zepp's
   displayed HRV), temperature constants, sleep-session minute base (midnight vs noon).
10. **Ack semantics**: fetch a type, ack `09`, fetch again with the same *since*: same data
    re-delivered? Then (once, on a window already validated) ack `01` and fetch again.
11. **Tier 0 live HR**: with Heart Rate Push on, connect **without** auth and subscribe to
    `0x2A37`; then with it off. Note RR-interval presence (flag bit 4).
12. **Coexistence**: with the Zepp app installed but force-quit, does it steal the
    connection? After uninstalling Zepp, does the key keep working across strap reboots?

Device controls (§11–§15). Before any **write** in items 16–19, write down the strap's alarms
as the Zepp app shows them, so they can be restored by hand.

13. **Services list, controls rows**: are `0x001A`, `0x000F`, `0x0018`, `0x001E` present, and
    with which encryption flags? Promotes the new §3.5 rows.
14. **Find-device capabilities**: send `01` on `0x001A` and record the full reply (expected
    `02 01 <version>`). Record the version byte. Promotes §11.2.
15. **Find device, continuous vs one-shot**: send `03` once and nothing else. Time the vibration
    with a stopwatch: does it stop by itself, and after how long? Is `07` (§11.3) sent when it
    stops? Then send `03`, wait 5 s, send `06`: does it stop at once? Then `03`, `06` 500 ms
    later: one short buzz? Promotes §11.3 and §11.4.
16. **Find device before auth**: after connecting, send `03` on `0x001A` in plaintext **before**
    the auth handshake. Record any reply or disconnect, and whether the strap vibrates.
    Expected: nothing. Promotes §11.6.
17. **Alarms read**: send `09` on `0x000F` with a known set of alarms made in Zepp (including one
    disabled, one one-shot, one with smart wake if Zepp offers it). Check that the reply length
    is 2 + 10 × count, that the fields match §12.3, and what the 5 tail bytes hold. Promotes §12.3.
18. **Alarm write**: make a once-alarm in a free slot for 2 minutes ahead (§15.2 sequence).
    Check the ack status byte; check it fires, how long it vibrates, and whether tapping stops
    it; check whether any message reaches the phone when it fires or is dismissed. Then delete it
    and check the ack. Check whether the Zepp app (if still installed) shows it; re-read to see
    what became of the fired once-alarm. Promotes §12.2 (ack status), §12.3 (once alarms) and
    §12.5.
19. **Alarm capabilities**: send `01` on `0x000F` and record the reply. It is read-only in every
    reference, but its layout is unknown. Does it report the slot count? Promotes §12.2 and
    §12.4.
20. **Config groups and haptic args**: record the config capabilities reply (§5.5) and a
    constraints-included read of group `0x03` (all §13.4 args) and group `0x08` args `02 03 14 32 41
    42 43 44 45 46 51`. Which are present on the Helio, and with which allowed values? Promotes
    §13.4.
21. **Strap-originated find phone**: is there any gesture (e.g. a multi-tap) that makes the strap
    send `11` on `0x001A`? Promotes §11.5.

### 10.1 Results from a real strap (2026-09-30)

Juan ran HelioVerify against his Helio Strap: hardware revision 0.132.27.2, firmware 3.3.6.5
per his Zepp account, macOS CoreBluetooth, local time UTC−4 (offset byte `f0`), every ack
`03 09`, no time or setting written. Source tag for everything below: `HW:2026-09-30 (hw 0.132.27.2)`. Only control bytes and
lengths are recorded here; no health value, serial number, MAC or setting value is.

| §10 item | Result | Promoted |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Advertisement | Not recorded in this run. | — |
| 2 GATT dump | Present: `…0016`, `…0017`, `…0004`, `…0005`, `0x2A37`, `0x2A19`, `0x2A2B`, `0x2A27`. **No DIS firmware revision `0x2A26`**, so the firmware version was not printed. Parent services, properties and write types not recorded. | §1, §2 |
| 3 Auth | The real key authenticated. The wrong-key test (`10 05 25`) was **not run**. | §4.3 success path, §4.4 session key |
| 4 Services list | 28 endpoints (listed in §3.5). `0x004B` is present. Battery `0x0029`, connection `0x0015` and `0x004B` are plaintext on this strap. | §3.5, §5.2 |
| 5 Encrypted round-trip | Replies on `0x000A` and `0x001A` decrypted, and their trailer CRC matched `CRC-32(P ‖ S)`. (Battery could not serve: it is plaintext here.) Whether the device's sequence numbers are its own or follow ours was not recorded. | §3.3 |
| 6 Chunk acks | Not recorded. | — |
| 7 Time set | **Not run** (HelioVerify's `--set-time` is off by default). | — |
| 8 HEALTH config read | Config service version 3, groups `00 0b 08 09 0a`; HEALTH group `0x08` version 3. Argument values are personal settings and are not recorded here. Arg `0x05` vs Zepp's "Heart Rate Push": not tested. | §5.5 |
| 9 Fetch each type | Path A, 30-minute and 12-hour windows. Start replies are 16 bytes. **Activity's length counts records**; every other type counts bytes and its CRC matched (table below). Values were not compared with Zepp. | §6.1, §6.2, §6.4, §6.5 |
| 10 Ack semantics | After `03 09`, fetching an overlapping temperature window again **re-delivered** the data. A mid-transfer `03 09` was tolerated. Ack `01`: **not run**. | §6.3 |
| 11 Tier 0 live HR | Without auth: **not run**. With auth (§7.1 start + keep-alive): one `0x2A37` notification per second. | §7.1 |
| 12 Coexistence | **Not tested.** | — |

**Fetch rounds** (item 9):

| Type | Window | Announced length → data received | Unit | CRC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| activity `0x01` | 30 min | `30` → one 241-byte packet: counter + 240 bytes = 30 × 8 | **records** | unknown: ZeppKit aborted the round with a false overflow before the check (fixed since) |
| activity `0x01` | 12 h | `720` → ZeppKit aborted at 960 bytes | **records** | unknown |
| temperature `0x2e` | 30 min / 12 h | `240` → 240 B / 5760 B | bytes | ok |
| stress-auto `0x13` | 12 h | 720 B (1 byte per minute) | bytes (= records here) | ok |
| HRV `0x49` | — | 2136 B = 356 × 6 | bytes | ok |
| SpO₂ `0x25` | — | 6566 B = 1 + 101 × 65 | bytes | ok |
| resting HR `0x3a` | — | 6 B | bytes | ok |
| sleep respiratory rate `0x38` | — | 3528 B = 441 × 8 | bytes | ok |
| sleep session `0x48` | — | 594 B | bytes | ok |
| PAI `0x0d` | — | 102 B | bytes | ok |
| sleep SpO₂ `0x26` | — | 421 B = 1 + 14 × 30 | bytes | ok, but every record decoded to the same SpO₂ value: **the §6.5 field layout for `0x26` is 🔴** (out of v1 scope; parser unchanged) |

- For the per-minute types the start timestamp equalled the requested *since*; for event
  types it was the first record's own time.
- **Empty start replies** (status `01`, length 0) came in two forms (§6.2): the far-future
  sentinel for types with nothing in the window (`0x3d`, `0x02`, `0x12`, and `0x26`'s second
  round), and the all-zero start on the follow-up round straight after a round that delivered
  data (`0x2e`, `0x13`). ZeppKit rejected the all-zero form as malformed and retried once
  (fixed since: length 0 is empty whatever the timestamp).
- The strap coped with ZeppKit's mid-transfer `03 09` on the activity round: it still sent
  its transfer done and `10 03 01`, and the next type fetched normally.

**Still untested** (keep their tags): wrong-key auth (`10 05 25`); ack `01` (delete); Tier 0
live HR without auth; Zepp-app coexistence; time set (`0x0047`, `06 01`); the HRV statistic
(RMSSD vs SDNN). Also not yet observed: the activity CRC; a full 12-hour activity round;
the firmware version over BLE (endpoint `0x0043`); the advertisement; chunk acks; write types;
Path B (`0x004B`); arg `0x05` vs "Heart Rate Push"; the device's sequence numbers; any value
compared against Zepp (HRV unknown byte, temperature constants, sleep-session minute base);
the `0x26` layout.

## 11. Find device (endpoint `0x001A`)

This section and §12–§15 are the **device-controls addendum** (2026-09-30). The Helio Strap has
a vibration motor and no display (§1). Amazfit documents three phone-triggered or scheduled
vibrations: "Find Device" (60 s, continuous), up to 10 alarms (60 s, stopped by tapping the
strap) and a set of health alerts (§13.4). 🟡 `AMZ-S`, `AMZ-M p.2-3,10-12`. HelioCore implements
none of this (no match for vibration, alarm or find anywhere in `HC`), so every protocol fact
below comes from Gadgetbridge alone, plus two Helio tester reports in its tracker.

### 11.1 Channel

| Fact | Tag / source |
|---|---|
| Find device and find phone share endpoint **`0x001A`**. | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:34` |
| It is **encrypted by default**. As always, the services list (§5.2) can override that. | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:60`, `SVC/Services:83-85` |
| Gadgetbridge sends only the capabilities request (§11.2) at session setup, and only if the services list contains `0x001A`. It sends start/stop commands whenever the user asks, **without** checking the services list. OpenCircuit must be stricter (§14). | 🟡 `GB/service/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsSupport.java:947-951`, `SVC/FindDevice:139,149-154` |

### 11.2 Capabilities and version

Send `01`. The strap replies with three bytes, `02 <b1> <version>`. 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:36-37,73-82`

| Byte | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[0]` = `02` | capabilities reply |
| `[1]` | `01` in every example Gadgetbridge records; not interpreted. 🔴 probably a status byte |
| `[2]` | **find-device service version**. Gadgetbridge records version `01` on a Mi Band 7 and `02` on an Active 2 and a GTR 4. |

A reply that isn't exactly 3 bytes is ignored, and the version stays 0. **Version ≥ 2 means the
strap supports continuous find** (§11.4). 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:76-81,86,199-201`. The Helio's version
is not recorded anywhere: 🔴 (§10 item 14).

### 11.3 Messages

| Bytes | Direction | Meaning | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01` | phone → strap | capabilities request (§11.2) | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:36,139` |
| `02 …` | strap → phone | capabilities reply (§11.2) | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:37,73-82` |
| **`03`** | phone → strap | **start** "find device": the strap starts vibrating | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:38,179-185` |
| `04` | strap → phone | the strap acknowledges a **start**. No further bytes are read. 🔴 whether it also acknowledges a stop. | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:39,83-94` |
| **`06`** | phone → strap | **stop** "find device" | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:40,180` |
| `07` | strap → phone | the strap stopped "find device" on its own side. Gadgetbridge only logs it. 🔴 whether it is sent after a tap on the strap, after the strap's own timeout, or both. | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:41,106-108` |
| `11` | strap → phone | the strap asks the phone to ring ("find phone", §11.5) | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:42,95-105` |
| `12 01` | phone → strap | acknowledgement of `11` (`01` = success) | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:43,187-191` |
| `13` | strap → phone | the strap ends "find phone" | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:44,109-113` |
| `14` | phone → strap | the phone ends "find phone" (the user found it) | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:45,193-197` |
| `15 <mode>` | strap → phone | find-phone mode: `00` vibrate only, `01` ring | 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:46,114-126` |

Opcodes `05`, `08`–`10` and everything above `15` are not used by any reference. Ignore unknown
opcodes; never send them.

### 11.4 One-shot vs continuous, and how long the strap buzzes

- **Continuous** (version ≥ 2): one `03` makes the strap vibrate until it is told to stop with
  `06` (or until it stops on its own, see below). 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:86-92`,
  `GB@bbd9868e` (the commit that added version-based continuous-find detection, 2025-04-03).
- **One-shot** (version < 2): each `03` plays **one** burst, using the strap's "find band"
  vibration pattern (type `09`, §13.1). To keep it going, Gadgetbridge waits for the `04` ack and
  then sends another `03` after a delay. The delay is the total length of the find-band pattern
  (on + off times, multiplied by its repeat count), capped at 10 s. When the pattern is the
  device default, Gadgetbridge doesn't know its length and uses 10 s. It stops the cycle when the
  user presses stop, and then sends `06`. 🟡 `SVC/FindDevice:83-94,149-154`,
  `GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiUtils.java:46-70`
- **Helio evidence** (🟡, one Gadgetbridge tester each):
  - Gadgetbridge's find device on a Helio Strap is "continuous until stopped … a repeating series
    of vibrations that continues indefinitely until you tap 'Found It!'" (`GB#6715`, comment of
    2026-09-06).
  - With Gadgetbridge's call handling (a single `03` when the call rings and `06` when it is
    answered or ends; **no** re-send loop), the tester got "continuous vibration for incoming calls
    until hung up" (`GB#6755`, 2026-09-12). A single `03` therefore keeps the Helio vibrating for at
    least a ring's length. That strongly suggests the Helio is a version ≥ 2 (continuous) device.
    🔴 until §10 item 14 records the version byte.
- **Duration**: Amazfit says "Find Device" in the Zepp app makes the strap "vibrate continuously
  for 60 seconds" (`AMZ-M p.3`). 🔴 **whether the 60 s limit is enforced by the strap or by the
  Zepp app** sending `06`. The Gadgetbridge tester's "indefinitely" argues for the app, but it
  would also be true if the strap were one-shot and Gadgetbridge's 10 s re-send loop were running.
  §10 item 15 decides.
- **Gadgetbridge pitfall (don't copy)**: Gadgetbridge's settings code reads the find-device version
  from a stored preference that its find-device code never writes, so its *settings* always
  treat a Zepp OS device as one-shot (and offer a "find band" vibration pattern). Its find loop
  uses the version from the live reply and is unaffected. `SVC/FindDevice:48-49,77,199-201`
  (no preference update anywhere in that file), `GB/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsCoordinator.java:584-586,606-608`.

**OpenCircuit rule** (🔴 recommendation):
- Always send `06` when finding ends: when the user stops it, and **after 60 s of phone-side time**
  at the latest. Never rely on the strap's own timeout.
- Version ≥ 2: send one `03`.
- Version < 2, or no well-formed capabilities reply: send `03`, and on each `04` send another
  `03` 10 s later, until 60 s have passed. Then send `06`.
- If the link drops while finding, the strap may keep vibrating until its own timeout (unknown).
  On the next authenticated connection, if a find was active when the link dropped, send `06`
  once.
- Treat `07` from the strap as "finding stopped" and update the UI.

### 11.5 Find phone (strap → phone)

Some Zepp OS devices can ask the phone to ring. The strap sends `11`. Gadgetbridge replies at
once with `12 01`, because a device only sends its mode after that acknowledgement. It then
waits 1.5 s for an optional `15 <mode>` (`00` vibrate only, `01` ring) before it starts ringing
(ring if no mode arrives). `13` from the strap, or `14` from the phone, ends it. 🟡
`SVC/FindDevice:95-126,187-197`. 🔴 **whether the Helio can send `11` at all**: it has no screen or
button, and Amazfit documents no gesture for it (`AMZ-M`). §10 item 21. v1: answer `11` with
`12 01` and show a local notification. That is harmless and needs no UI beyond it.

### 11.6 Before authentication

Endpoint `0x001A` is encrypted by default (§11.1), and before auth there is no session key.
Every reference sends find-device commands only after auth and the services list (§5). 🟡
`GB/service/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsSupport.java:900-951`. 🔴 whether the strap would accept a
**plaintext** `03` before auth (§10 item 16). **Rule: find device requires a completed auth.**
Without the key there is no find device and no buzz (the plan of record's "key required"
decision). ZeppKit's refusal to send encrypted messages before the session is confirmed already
enforces this.

### 11.7 Worked example E: find device start and stop (constructed, made-up key)

This continues worked examples B and C: the same session key
`8c 45 6e 06 23 92 2f ab 73 ce 01 a0 cd dd ee ff`. After example B the encrypted-sequence
number is `0x2933d232`. Start is the connection's 4th message (handle `0x04`); stop is the 5th
(handle `0x05`). `0x001A` is encrypted (the default). `OC-vec`

| Step | Start (`03`) | Stop (`06`) |
|---|---|---|
| message key = session key XOR handle | `88 41 6a 02 27 96 2b af 77 ca 05 a4 c9 d9 ea fb` | `89 40 6b 03 26 97 2a ae 76 cb 04 a5 c8 d8 eb fa` |
| `P ‖ S` | `03` `32 d2 33 29` | `06` `33 d2 33 29` |
| CRC-32 over `P ‖ S` | `0xe374a1e5` → `e5 a1 74 e3` | `0x932849f0` → `f0 49 28 93` |
| padded plaintext (1 + 4 + 4 = 9 → 16) | `03 32 d2 33 29 e5 a1 74 e3` + 7 × `00` | `06 33 d2 33 29 f0 49 28 93` + 7 × `00` |
| AES-128-ECB(message key) | `8f 01 cd 1e ad c4 db 8b e8 24 03 ae 5b ff 55 45` | `75 74 e9 d5 fa 93 f4 4d a0 fb 8c 33 b2 52 53 cd` |
| next sequence number | `0x2933d233` | `0x2933d234` |

At MTU 247 each is one 27-byte chunk; at MTU 23 each takes two chunks (the first chunk has room
for 9 data bytes, §3.2):

```
MTU 247, start (27 B): 03 0f 00 04 00 | 01 00 00 00 | 1a 00 | 8f 01 cd 1e ad c4 db 8b e8 24 03 ae 5b ff 55 45
MTU 247, stop  (27 B): 03 0f 00 05 00 | 01 00 00 00 | 1a 00 | 75 74 e9 d5 fa 93 f4 4d a0 fb 8c 33 b2 52 53 cd

MTU 23, start:  chunk 0 (20 B): 03 09 00 04 00 | 01 00 00 00 | 1a 00 | 8f 01 cd 1e ad c4 db 8b e8
                chunk 1 (12 B): 03 0e 00 04 01 | 24 03 ae 5b ff 55 45
```

The total-length field is `01`: the plaintext length (§3.3). The strap then replies `04` on
`0x001A` (its own handle and encryption). If the services list had flagged `0x001A` plaintext,
the start would instead be one 12-byte chunk: `03 07 00 04 00 01 00 00 00 1a 00 03`.

A **short buzz** (§13.2) is exactly this pair with the stop sent 500 ms after the start.

## 12. Alarms (endpoint `0x000F`)

### 12.1 Channel

| Fact | Tag / source |
|---|---|
| Alarms use endpoint **`0x000F`**, **plaintext by default** (the services list may override). | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:47,72` |
| The Helio stores **up to 10 alarms**. Each vibrates for 60 s and is stopped by tapping the front of the strap repeatedly. They are made in Zepp › Device › Helio Strap › Alarm. | 🟡 `AMZ-M p.2,3,12`, `AMZ-S` |

### 12.2 Commands

| Bytes | Direction | Meaning | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01` | phone → strap | capabilities request. **Defined but never sent by Gadgetbridge**; the reply (`02 …`) layout is unknown. | 🔴 `SVC/Alarms:49-50` |
| `03 01 <record>` | phone → strap | **create or replace** the alarm in the slot named inside the 10-byte record (§12.3). Gadgetbridge uses this for new alarms *and* for every change to an existing one, including enable/disable. The `01` is not explained; 🔴 it is probably the number of records that follow. Always send `01` and one record. | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:51,144-171` |
| `04 <status>` | strap → phone | create ack | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:52,83-85` |
| `05 01 <slot>` | phone → strap | **delete** the alarm in `<slot>` (same unexplained `01`) | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:53,172-179` |
| `06 <status>` | strap → phone | delete ack | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:54,86-88` |
| `07 …` | phone → strap | "update". It exists, but its layout is unknown and Gadgetbridge never sends it. **Never send it.** | 🔴 `SVC/Alarms:55` |
| `08 <status>` | strap → phone | update ack | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:56,89-91` |
| `09` | phone → strap | **read all alarms** | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:57,114-118` |
| `0a <count> <record>…` | strap → phone | alarm list: `count` (u8), then `count` × 10-byte records. The payload must be exactly 2 + 10 × `count` bytes; otherwise discard the whole reply. | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:58,96-99,184-196` |
| `0f` | strap → phone | **the alarms changed on the strap**. Gadgetbridge re-reads the list with `09`; any further bytes are ignored. | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:59,92-95` |

The ack **status** byte is only logged by Gadgetbridge. 🔴 `01` = success, by analogy with every
other Zepp OS ack in this document. Treat anything else, or no ack, as a failure.

**Enable/disable** has no command of its own. Re-send the whole record with `03 01` and the
enabled bit changed. 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:151-157`

### 12.3 One alarm record (10 bytes)

The record is identical in the create command (after `03 01`) and in each entry of the `0a` list.
🟡 `SVC/Alarms:61-69,158-171,234-246`

```
 +-------+------+------+--------+--------+-------------------------+
 | flags | slot | hour | minute | repeat | 5 bytes, meaning unknown |
 +-------+------+------+--------+--------+-------------------------+
   [0]     [1]    [2]     [3]      [4]          [5..9]
```

| Offset | Field | Encoding | Tag / source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[0]` | flags | bit 0 (`0x01`) **smart wake**; bit 1 (`0x02`) unknown, never set by Gadgetbridge; bit 2 (`0x04`) **enabled**; bits 3–7 not used by any reference | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:67-69,151-157,239-240` |
| `[1]` | slot | position 0–9. It is the alarm's identity: there is no other id. | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:62,162,238`, `GB/devices/huami/HuamiCoordinator.java:155-157` |
| `[2]` | hour | 0–23, the **strap's local wall-clock time** (whatever §5.1 last set) | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:63,163` |
| `[3]` | minute | 0–59 | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:64,164` |
| `[4]` | repeat | day bitmask, **Monday = bit 0** … **Sunday = bit 6**: `01` Mon, `02` Tue, `04` Wed, `08` Thu, `10` Fri, `20` Sat, `40` Sun. `00` = **once** (no repeat); `1f` = Mon–Fri; `7f` = every day. Bit 7 is never set. | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:65,165,243`, `GB/model/Alarm.java:32-41` |
| `[5..9]` | unknown | Gadgetbridge writes five `00`s. It notes that `[8]` is `00` in what it sends but `01` in what the device returns. Ignore them on read; write `00`s. | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:166-170` |

**Pitfall:** this day mask is **Monday-first**, while the time command's day-of-week byte (§5.1)
counts **Sunday = 0**. Don't share a helper between them.

**Once alarms**: the record has no date. Gadgetbridge sends the hour and minute only; the strap
presumably fires at the next occurrence. 🔴 whether a fired once-alarm is then disabled, deleted
or kept by the strap (§10 item 18: re-read after it fires).

**Fields a display-less strap has no use for, or that don't exist:**
- **Label / title**: no field in the record. There is no way to send one. 🟡 (absent from the layout)
- **Snooze**: no field. Gadgetbridge's view is that Zepp OS alarms always snooze and that no flag
  disables it (`GB/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsCoordinator.java:319-322`, said of the watches).
  Amazfit documents only "tap to stop" for the Helio (`AMZ-M p.2,12`). 🔴 whether the strap
  snoozes at all.
- **Sound**: none; the strap has only the motor.
- **Smart wake**: Gadgetbridge offers the bit on every slot of every Zepp OS device
  (`ZeppOsCoordinator.java:325-327`). Amazfit's Helio documents don't mention smart wake. 🔴
  whether the Helio honours the bit. The smart-wake window is not in the known fields (🔴 maybe
  in `[5..9]`).

### 12.4 Capacity

- **10 slots, numbered 0–9.** Amazfit documents 10 (`AMZ-M p.12`). Gadgetbridge hard-codes 10 for
  every Zepp OS device and silently drops anything beyond (`HuamiCoordinator.java:155-157`,
  `SVC/Alarms:120-131`). 🟡
- **The strap does not report its capacity** through any path a reference uses. The `01`
  capabilities reply (§12.2) might, but its layout is unknown. 🔴
- Defensive rule: if a list reply has `count` > 10, a slot ≥ 10, or the same slot twice, treat
  alarms as **unsupported for this connection** and write nothing (§14).

### 12.5 Strap → phone messages

| Event | Message | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| alarms edited on the strap side (e.g. by another central, or a once-alarm expiring 🔴) | `0f` on `0x000F` | 🟡 `SVC/Alarms:92-95` |
| an alarm **fires** | **none known** | 🔴 |
| an alarm is **dismissed** (tap) | **none known** | 🔴 |

So the phone cannot know that an alarm rang or was dismissed. Don't build features on it. §10
item 18 checks for any unexpected message during a fire.

### 12.6 Worked example F: set a 06:30 weekday alarm (constructed)

Precondition: a read (§15.2 step 2) returned one alarm, in slot 3, so the lowest free slot is 0.
The new alarm is slot 0, enabled, no smart wake, 06:30, Monday–Friday.

```
record  = 04 00 06 1e 1f 00 00 00 00 00
          |  |  |  |  |  +------------- 5 unknown bytes, written as 00
          |  |  |  |  +---------------- repeat 0x1f = Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri
          |  |  |  +------------------- minute 0x1e = 30
          |  |  +---------------------- hour 6
          |  +------------------------- slot 0
          +---------------------------- flags 0x04 = enabled, no smart wake
payload = 03 01 04 00 06 1e 1f 00 00 00 00 00      (12 bytes)
```

Plaintext (the default for `0x000F`), handle `0x06`: `OC-vec`

```
MTU 247 (23 B): 03 07 00 06 00 | 0c 00 00 00 | 0f 00 | 03 01 04 00 06 1e 1f 00 00 00 00 00

MTU 23:  chunk 0 (20 B): 03 01 00 06 00 | 0c 00 00 00 | 0f 00 | 03 01 04 00 06 1e 1f 00 00
         chunk 1 ( 8 B): 03 06 00 06 01 | 00 00 00
```

Expected reply on `0x000F`: `04 01` (create ack; status `01` 🔴). Then re-read: example G. To
**disable** this alarm later, send `03 01 00 00 06 1e 1f 00 00 00 00 00` (flags `00`). To
**delete** it, send `05 01 00` and expect `06 01`.

If the services list flags `0x000F` as encrypted, encrypt as in §3.3. The values below use the
session of example C with sequence number `0x2933d234` (right after example E), handle `0x06`.
`OC-vec`

| Step | Bytes |
|---|---|
| message key = session key XOR `0x06` | `8a 43 68 00 25 94 29 ad 75 c8 07 a6 cb db e8 f9` |
| `P ‖ S` | `03 01 04 00 06 1e 1f 00 00 00 00 00` `34 d2 33 29` |
| CRC-32 over those 16 bytes | `0xe7a148e8` → `e8 48 a1 e7` |
| padded plaintext (12 + 4 + 4 = 20 → 32) | the 16 bytes above, `e8 48 a1 e7`, 12 × `00` |
| AES-128-ECB(message key) | `29 21 7f fc d3 8d a4 6a aa de c6 76 68 0b e7 b8 1e 23 15 f1 6c 90 5e e2 98 9b 17 90 c0 78 3d 6c` |
| one chunk at MTU 247 (43 B) | `03 0f 00 06 00 0c 00 00 00 0f 00` + the 32 ciphertext bytes |
| next sequence number | `0x2933d235` |

### 12.7 Worked example G: read back a list of 2 alarms (constructed)

The re-read after example F (§15.2 step 7):

```
→ 09
← 0a 02
     04 00 06 1e 1f 00 00 00 01 00
     01 03 09 0f 60 00 00 00 01 00
```

Length check: 2 + 2 × 10 = 22 bytes ✓. Decoded:

| Slot | Enabled | Smart wake | Time | Repeat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | yes (flags `04`) | no | 06:30 | `1f` Mon–Fri |
| 3 | **no** (flags `01`: only the smart-wake bit) | yes | 09:15 | `60` Sat + Sun |

Slot 0 is example F's alarm. Free slots: 1, 2, 4–9. Byte `[8]` of each record is `01`, as
Gadgetbridge says the device returns; a parser must ignore it.

## 13. Vibration and other haptics

What the phone can make the motor do, from most to least useful for OpenCircuit.

### 13.1 Vibration patterns (endpoint `0x0018`)

| Fact | Tag / source |
|---|---|
| Endpoint **`0x0018`**, **encrypted by default**. | 🟡 `SVC/VibrationPatterns:44,50` |
| **Set** = `03`, u8 **type**, u8 **source** (`01` custom pattern follows, `00` use the device's built-in default), u8 **test** (`01` = also play it now, `00` = store only), u8 **n** = number of on/off pairs, then n × (u16 LE **on** ms, u16 LE **off** ms). With source `00`, n is `00` and nothing follows. | 🟡 `SVC/VibrationPatterns:113-136` |
| Reply `04 <status>` (only logged). | 🟡 `SVC/VibrationPatterns:47,59-68` |
| Gadgetbridge caps a pattern at **10 s** in total (on + off), dropping any pair that would exceed it. It attributes the limit to the official app. | 🟡 `SVC/VibrationPatterns:117-120`, `GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiUtils.java:72-100` |
| **There is no read command.** Gadgetbridge can't read the strap's patterns back and marks that as unresolved. | 🟡 `SVC/VibrationPatterns:71-77` |
| Gadgetbridge **writes every type on every connect**, with source `00` (device default) for any type the user has not customised in Gadgetbridge. Connecting Gadgetbridge therefore resets any custom pattern made in Zepp. **Don't copy that.** | 🟡 `SVC/VibrationPatterns:71-77,104-110`, `GB/devices/huami/HuamiCoordinator.java:438-483` |

**Type codes** 🟡 `GB/service/devices/huami/HuamiVibrationPatternNotificationType.java:24-33`, and
which of them Gadgetbridge configures on Zepp OS (`GB/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsCoordinator.java:570-593`):

| Type | Meaning | Gadgetbridge sets it on Zepp OS | Plausible on the Helio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `00` | app notifications | always | 🔴 no: the strap is not sent notifications (§13.3) |
| `01` | incoming call | always | 🔴 no, same reason |
| `02` | incoming SMS | always | 🔴 no, same reason |
| `04` | goal reached | always | 🔴 only if the strap has goal alerts (§13.4) |
| `05` | alarm | always | 🔴 probably: the strap fires alarms itself |
| `06` | idle / inactivity alert | always | 🔴 only if the strap has inactivity alerts (§13.4) |
| `08` | event reminder | if the reminders capability reports slots | 🔴 unknown |
| `09` | find band | when find device is one-shot (always, given the §11.4 pitfall) | 🔴 only for one-shot find |
| `0a` | to-do list | never (not implemented) | — |
| `0c` | schedule | never (not implemented) | — |

🔴 **Whether the Helio implements `0x0018` at all** is unknown (§10 item 13). 🔴 Whether a set
with test = `01` also **stores** the pattern: assume it does.

Layout illustration (constructed; **v1 must not send it**, see §15): alarm type, custom, play
now, two pairs of 400 ms on / 200 ms off →
`03 05 01 01 02 90 01 c8 00 90 01 c8 00`.

### 13.2 "Vibrate now"

No reference has a dedicated "vibrate now" or motor-test opcode for Zepp OS. Two ways exist:

| Method | How | Tag / source | Use in OpenCircuit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Find-device pulse** | send `03` on `0x001A`, then `06` 500 ms later | 🟡 on the Helio: Gadgetbridge's notification buzz (`SVC/FindDevice:166-171`, `GB@4e786b26`), which a Helio tester reports gives a "single vibration" (`GB#6755`, 2026-09-12) | **Yes.** The only transient buzz. The length of the buzz for a given delay is 🔴 (what the strap plays between start and stop). |
| Pattern test | §13.1 set with test = `01` | 🔴 not reported on the Helio; may persist | **No.** It can overwrite a stored pattern that can't be read back. |

### 13.3 Notifications and calls on a strap without a display

- Zepp OS normally sends notifications on endpoint `0x001E` (encrypted by default), and the watch
  shows and buzzes them. 🟡 `SVC/Notification:59,98`
- **Gadgetbridge never uses `0x001E` for the Helio Strap.** For a device without a display (except
  the Helio Ring), it turns each phone notification into a find-device pulse (§13.2), and an
  incoming call into find-device start, with stop when the call is answered or ends. The
  user-facing "send app notifications" switch still applies. 🟡
  `GB/service/devices/huami/zeppos/ZeppOsSupport.java:414-438`, added in `GB@4e786b26`
  (2026-09-12, `GB#6755`, closing `GB#6715`). A Helio tester confirmed both behaviours
  (`GB#6755`). Gadgetbridge's website now lists "calls and notifications (vibrating the strap)"
  for the Helio (gadgetbridge.org, Amazfit gadgets page, fetched 2026-09-30).
- The Helio Ring (also no display) is excluded from that path and is sent real notifications on
  `0x001E`. 🟡 same lines. OpenCircuit's controls are specified for the **strap only**.
- Gadgetbridge hides the vibration-pattern and "sound and vibration" settings for devices without
  a display (`ZeppOsCoordinator.java:483-505`).
- **For OpenCircuit**: an iOS app can't observe other apps' notifications or calls, so relaying
  them isn't possible the way Gadgetbridge does it on Android. 🔴 whether the strap vibrates for
  iPhone notifications through ANCS on its own: Amazfit documents no notification feature for
  the Helio (`AMZ-M`). The pulse can still be used for OpenCircuit's **own** events (e.g. a sync
  finished, a health alert computed on the phone).

### 13.4 Strap-side haptic alerts configured through the config endpoint

These are **persistent settings** on the strap (§5.5 transport: endpoint `0x000A`, encrypted by
default; one write message per group). The strap evaluates them itself and vibrates without the
phone. Value types are §5.5's type codes. 🟡 `SVC/Config:390-402,467-576` unless stated.

**Constraint bytes follow the value** in a read with constraints included (e.g. a byte entry
is: arg, `10`, value, n, n allowed values). 🟡
`GB/service/devices/huami/zeppos/services/config/ConfigByte.java:27-41`. This fills in where §5.5 was
silent.

| Group | Arg | Type | Meaning | Encoding | Helio evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HEALTH `08` | `02` | byte | **high heart-rate alert** threshold | `00` = off, otherwise bpm. The allowed values come from the constraints; Gadgetbridge's own list is 100–150 in steps of 10 (`GB-res/values/arrays.xml:3073-3081`) | 🟡 Amazfit: alerts when HR stays above/below the limit for 10 consecutive minutes at rest, not during sleep (`AMZ-M p.10`, `AMZ-S`). Arg presence 🔴 |
| HEALTH `08` | `03` | byte | **low heart-rate alert** threshold | `00` = off, else bpm (Gadgetbridge: 40/45/50, `arrays.xml:3110-3115`) | same as above |
| HEALTH `08` | `14` | bool | **relax (stress) reminder** | `00`/`01` | 🟡 Amazfit: alerts when stress stays above the limit for 10 min at rest; needs stress monitoring (arg `13`, §5.5) on (`AMZ-M p.11`) |
| HEALTH `08` | `32` | byte | **low SpO₂ alert** threshold | `00` = off, else % (Gadgetbridge: 80/85/90, `arrays.xml:3124-3129`) | 🟡 Amazfit: alerts when SpO₂ stays below the value for 10 min, not during sleep; needs all-day SpO₂ (arg `31`) on (`AMZ-M p.10`) |
| HEALTH `08` | `41` | bool | **inactivity (sedentary) alert** | `00`/`01` | 🔴 not in Amazfit's Helio documents; a Helio user reported the sedentary reminder "not working" with Gadgetbridge (`GB#5799`, 2026-02-15) |
| HEALTH `08` | `42` / `43` | hh:mm | inactivity alert active window start / end | u8 hour, u8 minute | 🔴 |
| HEALTH `08` | `44` | bool | inactivity alert quiet window enabled | `00`/`01` | 🔴 |
| HEALTH `08` | `45` / `46` | hh:mm | quiet window start / end | u8 hour, u8 minute | 🔴 |
| HEALTH `08` | `51` | bool | **goal-reached alert** | `00`/`01` | 🔴 not in Amazfit's Helio documents |
| HEALTH `08` | `52`–`57` | see note | goals: steps (`52`: short if the HEALTH version is 1, int otherwise), calories (`53`, short), weight (`54`: short below version 3, int from 3), sleep (`55`, short), standing time (`56`, short), fat-burn time (`57`, short) | LE | 🔴 (`SVC/Config:528-533,595-625`) |
| SOUND & VIBRATION `03` | `09` | bool | vibrate for alerts | `00`/`01` | 🔴 group `03` may not exist on the strap |
| SOUND & VIBRATION `03` | `12` | byte | **vibration intensity** | `00` normal, `01` enhanced (`SVC/Config:1634-1637`) | 🔴 |
| SYSTEM `0a` | `0a` | byte | do-not-disturb mode | `00` off, `01` scheduled, `02` automatic, `03` always (`SVC/Config:1538-1543`) | 🔴 whether it exists on the strap, and whether it silences alarms or alerts |
| SYSTEM `0a` | `0b` / `0c` | hh:mm | DND schedule start / end | u8 hour, u8 minute | 🔴 |
| WORKOUT `09` | `41` | bool | workout-detection alert | `00`/`01` | 🔴 meaning (probably a buzz when an auto-detected workout starts) |

Other args in group `03` (`02` volume, `06` crown vibration, `07` alert tone, `08` cover to mute,
`0a` text-to-speech) are watch features. Ignore them.

Group versions: Gadgetbridge understands SOUND & VIBRATION version `02`, SYSTEM `01`, WORKOUT
`01` and HEALTH `01`–`03`. It discards a read reply whose version differs (HEALTH excepted).
So the args above are only known at those versions. 🟡 `SVC/Config:319-327,390-402`.
Echo the version from the read reply when writing (§9).

**Haptics with no known config key** (Amazfit, `AMZ-M p.2-5`): power-on/off buzz, pairing
success/failure buzz, **low-battery buzz at 20 %, 10 % and 5 %**, firmware-update done/failed
buzz, and the workout pace/speed/high-HR alerts (configured per workout in the Zepp app). None
of them can be triggered or configured by OpenCircuit.

**Gadgetbridge behaviour not to copy:** on the first HEALTH read reply of each connection it
**writes the user's fitness goals** to the strap (`SVC/Config:356-360`). That is a persistent write
that the user didn't ask for.

Worked example H (constructed): read the four HR/SpO₂/stress alert args with constraints, then
set the high-HR alert to 120 bpm. `OC-vec`

```
→ 03 01 08 04 02 03 14 32                 read, constraints on, HEALTH, 4 args
← 04 01 08 03 01 04                        ok, HEALTH v3, constraints included, 4 entries
     02 10 00 07 00 64 6e 78 82 8c 96      high HR: byte, value 00 (off); 7 allowed: 0,100,110,120,130,140,150
     03 10 00 04 00 28 2d 32               low HR:  byte, value 00 (off); 4 allowed: 0,40,45,50
     14 0b 00                              relax reminder: bool, off (bools carry no constraints)
     32 10 5a 04 50 55 5a 00               low SpO₂: byte, value 0x5a = 90 %; 4 allowed: 80,85,90,0
→ 05 08 03 00 01 02 10 78                  write HEALTH v3 (echoed), 1 entry: arg 02, byte, 0x78 = 120
← 06 01                                    write ack
```

120 is in the allowed list, so the write is valid. A value outside the list must be refused on
the phone and never sent.

### 13.5 What is 🔴 unknown for the Helio specifically

- the find-device version byte; whether the 60 s limit is strap-side; whether `07` is sent; how long a 500 ms pulse actually buzzes (§11);
- whether `0x0018` exists, which pattern types the strap uses, and whether a test also stores (§13.1);
- whether the smart-wake bit and any snooze exist; what happens to a once-alarm after it fires; the alarm ack status values; the alarm capabilities reply (§12);
- which of the §13.4 args the strap reports (Amazfit documents only the HR, SpO₂ and relax alerts);
- whether the strap can send find-phone `11` (§11.5);
- whether any command works before auth (§11.6).

---

## 14. Capability detection

**Rule: a control is shown only when the connected strap has positively reported support for
it in this connection. If support is absent, unknown or malformed, hide the control and never
send its commands.** Gadgetbridge is looser: it sends find device without checking the services
list (§11.1) and assumes 10 alarm slots.

| Feature | Show it only when | If absent |
|---|---|---|

Device gate: all of §11–§15 applies to a device identified as `Amazfit Helio Strap` (§1). The
Helio Ring shares the protocol, but Gadgetbridge routes it differently (§13.3). Keep the ring out
of scope until it is tested.

## 15. State safety

### 15.1 Persistent vs transient

| Command | Endpoint | Effect on strap state | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| find start `03` / stop `06`, pulse | `0x001A` | **transient**: stops within 60 s at most (phone-side rule, §11.4) | 🟡 |
| find-phone ack `12 01`, stop `14` | `0x001A` | transient | 🟡 |
| capabilities `01` (find, alarms, config); alarm read `09`; config read `03` | various | **read-only** | 🟡 |
| alarm create/replace `03 01 …` | `0x000F` | **persistent**: overwrites whatever the slot held, including an alarm the user made in Zepp | 🟡 |
| alarm delete `05 01 <slot>` | `0x000F` | **persistent and destructive** | 🟡 |
| alarm update `07` | `0x000F` | unknown: **never send** | 🔴 |
| vibration pattern set `03 …` | `0x0018` | **persistent, and cannot be read back**: the user's Zepp pattern is lost for good | 🟡 |
| vibration pattern test (test = `01`) | `0x0018` | 🔴 may also persist: treat as persistent | 🔴 |
| config write `05 …` | `0x000A` | **persistent**; can also change what the strap *records* (§5.5) | 🟡 |

**Never at session setup.** Connecting must not write alarms, patterns or config. Gadgetbridge
does all three on connect or on the first edit: it rewrites every one of its alarm slots
(creating or deleting each, `SVC/Alarms:120-182`), resets vibration patterns
(`SVC/VibrationPatterns:71-77`) and writes fitness goals (`SVC/Config:356-360`). OpenCircuit must
only write in response to an explicit user edit of that one item.

### 15.2 Alarm read-before-write sequence (🔴 recommendation, built from the facts above)

1. **Preconditions**: authenticated; `0x000F` in the services list; time set this connection
   (§5.1); no other alarm write in flight.
2. **Read**: send `09`, wait for `0a` (time out after a few seconds). Validate: length
   = 2 + 10 × count, count ≤ 10, every slot < 10 and unique. On failure: stop, write nothing,
   show "couldn't read alarms".
3. **Show the strap's list as the truth.** Keep no local alarm list that could be "synced" over it.
4. **User edits one alarm.** Build exactly one message for that slot:
   - new alarm → the **lowest free slot**; none free → refuse ("the strap already has 10 alarms");
   - change or enable/disable → `03 01` + the full record with only the edited fields changed,
     flags bits 0 and 2 as the user set them; unknown flag bits and bytes `[5..9]` written as `0`
     (the path Gadgetbridge has exercised);
   - delete → `05 01 <slot>`.
5. **Race check**: if a `0f` arrived after step 2, discard the edit's base, re-read (step 2) and
   ask the user to confirm again.
6. **Write, then wait for the ack** (`04` or `06`). Status other than `01`, or no ack → report
   failure; don't retry blindly.
7. **Re-read** (`09`) and confirm the slot holds what was written; display the re-read list.
8. Never touch a slot the user didn't edit; never write more than one alarm per user action.

### 15.3 Config write sequence (🔴 recommendation)

Read the group's args with constraints on (§13.4 example H) → validate the new value against the
allowed values or min/max → write **one** arg, echoing the group version from the read → expect
`06 01` → re-read the arg and show the strap's value.

### 15.4 Find device safety

- Always pair a start with a stop (§11.4): the user's stop button, the 60 s phone timer, and a
  stop on the next reconnect if the link dropped mid-find.
- No automatic find device or pulse at connect, sync or in the background without an explicit
  user action or setting. It is a physical interruption to the wearer.

## Changelog

- 2026-09-30: first version (zepp-spec agent, #215 Phase 0). All claims 🟡/🔴.
- 2026-09-30: device-controls addendum (zepp-controls-spec agent, #215): §11 find device, §12
  alarms, §13 vibration and haptic alerts, §14 capability detection, §15 state safety; four
  endpoints added to §3.5; source aliases `GB-res/`, `GB#N`, `GB@sha`, `AMZ-S`, `AMZ-M`; capture
  items 13–21 in §10; worked examples E–H. Sections 1–10 are otherwise unchanged. All new
  claims are 🟡/🔴.
- 2026-09-30: first hardware run (§10.1, hw 0.132.27.2). The start reply's length unit is per
  type: records for activity, bytes for the other types seen (§6.2, §6.5). Both empty
  start-reply forms documented: length 0 is empty whatever the timestamp. Confirmed claims
  promoted to 🟢; `0x26`'s field layout demoted to 🔴 (zepp-fix agent, #215).
