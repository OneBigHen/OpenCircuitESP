// TrainingLoad.swift — per-workout training load (Edwards' TRIMP) and the weekly trend (#232).
//
// METHOD. Edwards, S. (1993). "High performance training and racing." In: The Heart Rate Monitor
// Book, pp. 113–123. Feet Fleet Press. Time in each of five heart-rate zones (50–60, 60–70, 70–80,
// 80–90 and 90–100 % of maximum heart rate) is multiplied by the zone number (1–5) and summed:
//
//     TRIMP = Σ minutes_in_zone(z) × z,   z = 1…5
//
// INPUT. The workout's own 5-zone breakdown (`WorkoutZoneBreakdown`, #75) — the same numbers the
// workout screen draws as zone bars, so the load always agrees with what the user can see. Those
// zones are %maxHR with maxHR = 220 − age, which is Edwards' own zone basis. Two documented
// deviations, both in `docs/TRAINING_METRICS.md` §1: the app's zone boundaries sit at 50/61/71/81/91 %
// (not 50/60/70/80/90 %), and a minute without a heart-rate reading adds nothing (gaps are never
// filled, #45).
//
// Device-agnostic: the input is a zone breakdown, whichever wearable produced the heart rate.
// Pure value math, no HealthKit.
//
// NOT `Strain.edwardsTRIMP`: that is openwhoop's %HR-RESERVE variant on 1 Hz series with a
// 600-reading floor, feeding the 0…21 strain scale. This file is Edwards' original %HRmax form over
// the zone time the app already has.
