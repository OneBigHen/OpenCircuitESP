// Score a night that is already STORED, from the rows the app holds for it — #246, decision 48.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The ring scores a night as it persists it (`RingSession.computeSleepExtras`),
// straight off the `BulkRecord`s it just drained. Nothing else in the app could ever reproduce that
// number, so a night stored by any OTHER path — the Helio Strap's, whose records are parsed records
// and not `BulkRecord`s at all — kept `sleepScore == 0`, which is this column's app-wide "never
// computed" sentinel. Readiness is anchored on last night's Sleep Score
// (`WellnessBalance.anchoredScore` returns nil without one), so a strap wearer's Readiness card was
// permanently empty while every input for the score sat in the store.
//
// So this is the SAME formula, expressed over stored-row inputs instead of ring epochs:
//   • `SleepScore.composite` over the night's segments (`SleepStaging.summary`),
//   • `RestingHR.value` for the HR factor,
//   • the skin-temp offset against the SAME DEVICE's prior nights (`SkinTempBaseline.baseline`),
//   • `SleepStress.overnightScore` over the night's RMSSD for overnight recovery.
//
// ⚠️ IT TAKES VALUES, NOT A DEVICE, AND IT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ANY PROTOCOL. Which rows belong to
// the night, and which device measured them, is the store's job (decisions 28 and 29) — see
// `LocalStore+HelioNightScore.swift`. Keeping that out of here is what lets the same function serve
// both the store-time path and the repair pass, so a night scored at sync time and the same night
// scored later from its stored hypnogram cannot disagree.
//
// ⚠️ THE HRV STATISTIC IS 🟡. The strap's HRV is taken as RMSSD on Amazfit's product-line
// documentation (decision 44); no capture has compared the byte with the vendor app's number. So
// `stressScore` — overnight recovery — rests on an unconfirmed statistic wherever a strap feeds it.
// `SleepStress` wants RMSSD and that is what it is given; if the statistic turns out to be SDNN the
// mapping is wrong, and the fix belongs at the one place the value is read, not here.
//
// ⚠️ `nil` MEANS "NO SCORE", AND A COMPUTED 0 IS `nil`. `StoredSleepSummary.sleepScore` and
// `stressScore` use 0 as "not computed" (the Sleep card hides the badge, Trends filters it out,
// Readiness drops for the day), so a genuine 0 and a missing value are indistinguishable once
// stored. Reporting a computed 0 as a score would write the sentinel back and claim a repair that
// changed nothing — the same trap `SleepScoreHeal.healedScore` refuses.
