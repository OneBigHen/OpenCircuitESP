// WorkoutLiveMetrics.swift — pure rules for what a workout shows LIVE beyond time and heart rate
// (#283): GPS pace, and what a phone call does to a running workout. Foundation-only; the ring's
// `WorkoutSessionManager` and the strap's `StrapWorkoutRecorder` both feed the same Live Activity
// from these, so the two devices cannot disagree.
//
// NO-FABRICATION: every function returns nil rather than a guess. Pace needs real GPS distance
// over real running time, and a pace measured from fixes that stopped arriving is not "current".
