// VO2MaxEstimate.swift — a submaximal VO₂ max ESTIMATE from one outdoor run (#232).
//
// METHOD (docs/TRAINING_METRICS.md §2 has the citations and every threshold's origin):
//   1. Oxygen cost of running at the run's steady speed, from the ACSM metabolic equation:
//          VO₂ = 0.2 × S + 0.9 × S × G + 3.5        (mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹; S in m/min, G as a fraction)
//      American College of Sports Medicine, ACSM's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and
//      Prescription (metabolic equations, running). Grade only when the GPS elevation is reliable;
//      otherwise the segment is treated as flat.
//   2. Extrapolation to the maximum through %HRR ≈ %VO₂R (Swain DP, Leutholtz BC. "Heart rate
//      reserve is equivalent to %VO₂ reserve, not to %VO₂max." Med Sci Sports Exerc 1997;
//      29(3):410–414):
//          (HR − HRrest) / (HRmax − HRrest) = (VO₂ − 3.5) / (VO₂max − 3.5)
//      ⇒  VO₂max = 3.5 + (VO₂ − 3.5) × (HRmax − HRrest) / (HR − HRrest)
//   3. HRmax = the higher of Tanaka's age formula (208 − 0.7 × age; Tanaka H, Monahan KD, Seals DR.
//      "Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited." J Am Coll Cardiol 2001;37(1):153–156) and the
//      highest 1-minute mean heart rate seen in this run. HRrest = the app's nightly resting HR.
//
// Every refusal is a `SkipReason` the UI states in words. No input is ever defaulted: an unset age
// or a missing resting HR skips the estimate instead of borrowing a placeholder.
//
// Device-agnostic and pure: heart-rate samples, cumulative GPS distance and the profile in, a
// number or a reason out. No CoreLocation, no HealthKit.
