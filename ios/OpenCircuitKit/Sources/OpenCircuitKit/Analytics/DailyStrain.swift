// Daily strain (#216) — today's heart-rate samples, as stored, turned into one `Strain` score.
//
// `Strain.calculate(bpms:sampleSeconds:)` wants an evenly sampled series (openwhoop feeds it 1 Hz
// WHOOP data). Our stored heart rate is not that: the ring writes one POINT reading per 150 s epoch
// (`BulkRecord.epochSeconds`), the Helio Strap one per minute, and either may have gaps (not worn,
// not synced). So this expands the day's readings into a 1 Hz series first, and then hands that to
// `Strain.calculate` unchanged, with `sampleSeconds` 1 — so the minimum-data gate
// (`Strain.minReadings`, 600 readings) keeps its openwhoop meaning: 10 minutes of heart rate.
//
// How a reading becomes seconds (nothing is invented):
//   - a reading with a real span (end > start) covers exactly that span;
//   - a point reading holds until the next reading, but never longer than `maxPointSpan` (one ring
//     epoch). A gap longer than that counts as NO data, not as the last bpm carried forward;
//   - where two readings cover the same instant, the earlier one keeps it, so a live spot read
//     inside an epoch cannot add time (the same rule as `ExerciseMinutes.elevatedPieces`);
//   - readings outside `LiveHR.validBPM` are dropped, as `RestingHR` does.
//
// Inputs, and why:
//   maxHR     — `220 − age`, the convention every other HR-zone estimate here uses
//               (`Calories.dailyEstimate`, the workout recorder).
//   restingHR — the day's `RestingHR` value, the same number the Resting HR tile shows, so the two
//               tiles never disagree about the person's floor.
//
// Pure value-type math (no HealthKit / device / SwiftUI types) so it unit-tests on macOS.
