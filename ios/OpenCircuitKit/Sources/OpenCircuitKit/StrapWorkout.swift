// StrapWorkout.swift — pure rules for a workout the app records with the Amazfit Helio Strap (#227,
// decision 34): the strap's live heart rate plus the phone's GPS, written as one `HKWorkout`.
//
// The ring's workout (`WorkoutSessionAggregator`, `WorkoutSessionRecovery`) is left exactly as it is;
// these types add what the strap's recorder needs on top of it, without touching the ring's path:
//   • `WorkoutActivityLedger`: pauses (user) and gaps (link down), so the active duration and the
//     zones never count time the person paused, and a link drop is MARKED instead of papered over;
//   • `StrapWorkoutSummaryBuilder`: the ring's summary maths over the active segments only;
//   • `StrapWorkoutJournal` + `StrapWorkoutRecovery`: what a fresh process may claim about a workout
//     that was running when the app was killed: it closes at its LAST SAMPLE (never at "now").
// (How the readings enter `LocalStore` without moving the strap's watermarks, or reaching Apple Health
// a second time, is the app's: `LocalStore+StrapWorkout.swift`.)
//
// Same honesty rules as the ring's workout (#45): only real readings are recorded, gaps are never
// interpolated, and no number is reported that was not measured.
