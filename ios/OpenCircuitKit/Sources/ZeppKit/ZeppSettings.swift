//   6. re-read (§17.5) and show the strap's value as the truth.
// A non-`01` status, no `06`, and `06 01` with the old value on re-read all mean "the strap did not
// take the change" (§17.4): the re-read value is shown and nothing is retried. A late `06` is ignored.
// It never writes at session setup, never writes a value the user didn't change, never writes a
// parent as a side effect of a child, and never writes WORKOUT `40` (§19.3).
