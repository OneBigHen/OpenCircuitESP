// write-without-response flow control. Every protocol decision lives in `HelioSession` / ZeppKit.

// Its OWN central with its own restore identifier, so the ring's central (`RingScanner`) and this one
// never share state (decision 1: the inactive device is never scanned for or connected). Created
// lazily, like the ring's (#142), so merely constructing this object never prompts for Bluetooth.
// State restoration re-adopts the strap's peripheral; a session that connects then syncs on its own.
