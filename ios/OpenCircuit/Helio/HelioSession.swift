// The Amazfit Helio Strap as a `WearableSession` (#215 phase 3). One session per connection, like
// `RingSession`. It holds no CoreBluetooth: `HelioConnection` moves bytes between the radio and this
// class through `HelioTransport`, so the whole flow runs in tests against `FakeZeppDevice`.
//
// Connection sequence, mirroring HelioVerify (proven on a real strap, ZEPP_PROTOCOL.md §10.1):
//   read DIS hardware revision + battery level → enable notify on …0017 (+ …0016) → auth (§4) →
//   services list (§5.2) → device info (§5.3) → battery (§5.3) → set the clock (§5.1, decision 9) →
//   HEALTH recording switches (§5.5) → find-device capabilities (§11.2) → alarm list (§12) →
//   haptic alert settings (§13.4, read-only) → history fetch over Path A (§6), then Apple Health.
// Without a usable key the session stays keyless: standard 0x2A37 heart rate only, if the strap
// sends it unauthenticated (§7.1 Tier 0, decision 7). Nothing is ever written at setup except the
// clock (§15.1); alarm writes happen only on an explicit user edit, one slot at a time.
