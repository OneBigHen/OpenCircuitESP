/// ══ WHY THIS IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS ══
///
/// iOS will not run our code at a wall-clock instant in the background — no surviving timer, and a
/// delivered local notification doesn't execute anything. See the header of `RingAlarm.swift` for
/// the full argument. The consequence for this file is a two-track design:
///
///   • The BUZZ is opportunistic. `evaluate` is called from every scrap of runtime the app gets —
///     the keepalive tick, a CoreBluetooth background wake, scene activation, the BGTask — and
///     fires on the first one at or after the alarm time. Accuracy is bounded by how often the
///     ring pushes a frame, not by a clock we own.
///   • The NOTIFICATION is guaranteed. `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger` is scheduled by the OS and
///     fires regardless of what our process is doing. It defaults ON because it is the only half
///     of this feature that can actually be promised to someone who needs to wake up.
///
/// State is UserDefaults, not SwiftData, and deliberately: this is one small struct with no
/// relationships and no queries, and every SwiftData schema change on this project owes a
/// migration rehearsal on real hardware (docs/RUNBOOK_SCHEMA_MIGRATION_REHEARSAL.md — a past build
/// deleted every raw history row on upgrade). An alarm clock is not worth that risk surface.
