// The Amazfit Helio Strap's background sync (#215 phase 4, decision 26). The strap's counterpart of
// `RingBackgroundSyncService`, entered by the same wakes: the two existing BGTask identifiers and the
// Sleep Focus filter (AppDelegate, SleepFocusSyncFilter). CoreBluetooth state restoration is the
// third leg and needs no code here: `HelioConnection`'s own central relaunches the app, and a
// session that connects then syncs on its own (docs/BACKGROUND_SYNC.md Part B).
//
// One bounded run: connect if needed (by identifier, never a scan) → the session authenticates with
// the Keychain key, sets the clock and fetches (every round acked `03 09`, decision 8, and committed
// to `LocalStore` as it arrives) → flush to Apple Health → one line in the background-run log with a
// "helio strap:" label, plus a `bgphase` breadcrumb (B.4).
//
// Budget (B.3): the fetch gets the task's window minus `flushReserve`. When that runs out, or iOS
// expires the task, the open round is acked `03 09`, what was committed stays committed, the link is
// dropped cleanly (a running find gets its `06` first) and the rest stays on the strap for next time.
// Only an uninterrupted sync is followed by the Health flush inside the window; an abandoned one
// flushes only when the budget (not iOS) ended it. If the app is in front when the budget runs out,
// nothing is torn down: the sync is handed to the app, whose post-sync hook flushes it (review-225 S1).
//
// Key states (decision 7): no key, a rejected key (persisted), or a strap that ended busy earlier in
// this app launch end the run before any radio work; a session that turns out keyless, rejected,
// busy or unsupported ends it quietly. No retry, no Health write, and the log says why. "Busy" lasts
// for the launch only: the next launch (a background relaunch too) tries once more, which is how the
// strap comes back once Zepp lets go of it (review-225 F1).
