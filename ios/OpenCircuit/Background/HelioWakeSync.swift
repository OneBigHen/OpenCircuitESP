// Decision 33 (#233): the strap wakes the app; BGTasks are the backstop. Build 59's first night showed
// why: iOS granted the BGTasks only when it predicted the app would be opened, which is when they stop
// mattering. With the authenticated link kept up in the background (B.5) and a standing connect armed
// whenever it drops, these can wake a suspended app, and each runs at most one bounded catch-up sync:
//   • the link coming back (a pending connect completing, or a state-restoration relaunch), after
//     `reconnectCatchUpAfter` without a completed sync (ZEPP_PROTOCOL.md §16.3–§16.4: no strap message
//     is a dependable wake source). B.5 holds the link up, so a strap worn in range all night never
//     reconnects (decision 35);
//   • for that held link, anything the strap sends on its own over it (decision 35, `idleTraffic`),
//     gated exactly like a reconnect. Not dependable either: an idle authenticated link carries no
//     heart-rate stream (that needs `04 01` plus a `04 02` from the phone every second, §7.1, which
//     would be manufactured traffic), so this fires only if the strap pings or sends a §16.2 message;
//   • HealthKit delivering new iPhone steps (`HelioHealthWake`), for strap users who turned it on: the
//     only wake that doesn't depend on the strap;
//   • the strap's woke-up event (`06 00` on `0x001D`), an opportunistic hint only (§16.4: 🔴 whether
//     the Helio sends it). Nothing depends on it, and it carries no time: the catch-up fetches history
//     and only the night selection writes sleep.
// A catch-up is a `HelioBackgroundSyncService` run (the BGTask's budget, `03 09` acks and teardown, and
// the Health flush) under a `beginBackgroundTask` assertion. Every reconnect re-runs auth and setup
// with a fresh session (§4–§5, §9). Nothing here makes the strap talk: no realtime stream, no strap
// setting, no keep-alive traffic.
