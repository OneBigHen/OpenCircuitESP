// Scoring the Helio Strap's nights on the phone — #246, decision 48.
//
// THE DEFECT. `WellnessBalance.anchoredScore` returns nil without last night's Sleep Score, so
// Readiness on Today is anchored on it. The ring's nights are scored as they are stored
// (`RingSession.computeSleepExtras`), but `saveHelioNight` stored only the hypnogram and the nightly
// skin temperature, so a strap night kept `sleepScore == 0` — this column's app-wide "never
// computed" sentinel — and the Readiness card was permanently empty for a strap wearer while every
// input for the score sat in the store. Measured on the owner's phone, build 62: the strap's night
// had neither score, every earlier (ring) night had both, and the strap's heart rate, HRV and skin
// temperature for that night were all stored.
//
// WHAT IS HERE. Two call sites' worth of input-gathering, plus the repair pass:
//   • `applyHelioNightScores` fills a night's `extras` as it is saved;
//   • `scoreUnscoredHelioNights` scores strap nights already stored with no score.
// The arithmetic is `StoredNightScore` in the Kit, so the two cannot disagree about the number.
//
// ⚠️ DECISIONS 28 AND 29 ARE THE WHOLE REASON THIS IS NOT THREE LINES IN `LocalStore+Helio.swift`.
// A night is only scored when the STRAP owns it, every input row must be the strap's own, and the
// temperature baseline is the strap's own prior nights. A finger temperature and an arm temperature
// are not one baseline (decision 29), so letting a ring night into the baseline would turn every
// device switch into a fever signal. With an EMPTY ownership log (a ring-only install) nothing here
// does anything at all: `owner(ofNightFrom:to:)` is `.ringConn` for every night.
//
// ⚠️ OVERNIGHT RECOVERY RESTS ON A 🟡 STATISTIC. The strap's HRV is taken as RMSSD on Amazfit's
// product-line documentation (decision 44); no capture has compared the `0x49` byte with the vendor
// app's number. `SleepStress.overnightScore` wants RMSSD, and the strap's HRV is stored as
// `.hrvSDNN` (the only HRV column there is). If the statistic turns out to be SDNN, the stress
// number is wrong and this is one of the two places to fix.
//
// NOT A HEALTHKIT PATH, and no schema change. `sleepScore` and `stressScore` are ours alone — Sleep
// Score has no HealthKit type — so nothing here needs authorization or queues a reconcile.

    /// ⚠️ WHAT IT WILL NOT TOUCH, and each clause is load-bearing:
    ///   • a night the strap doesn't own — a ring night is the ring's to score (decision 28), and
    ///     with an empty ownership log EVERY night is the ring's, so a ring-only install is
    ///     byte-identical;
    ///   • a manually edited night — the wearer's word stands, and `applySleepEdit` writes its own
    ///     score (decision 13);
    ///   • a night with an empty stored hypnogram — there is nothing to score at second precision,
    ///     and the rounded minutes are not an acceptable substitute (`SleepScoreHeal`'s argument);
    ///   • a score that is already there — the predicate is `sleepScore == 0 || stressScore == 0`
    ///     and each write fills only a column that is still 0 (#259), so a stored number is never
    ///     replaced by one recomputed from thinner rows, and a night with both is skipped for ever
    ///     after, which is also what makes a second run a no-op.
    /// And it never writes a computed 0: `StoredNightScore` reports that as "no score", because
    /// writing the sentinel back would claim a repair that changed nothing.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ `row.updatedAt` IS BUMPED on a row it changes, and only then (#259): a candidate whose
    /// missing score still can't be computed, such as a night with no HRV, is left byte-identical.
