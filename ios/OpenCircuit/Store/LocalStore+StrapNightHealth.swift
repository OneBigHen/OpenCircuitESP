// covers that one sync (and is gone after a relaunch), so a night whose every re-delivery after its
// first store was kept as thinner, or that any other path left behind, was never offered again.
// Decision 57 (#262): the newest stored night too, 3 hours after its end. Decision 58a (#274) withdrew
// 57's faster path for a night ending near the scheduled wake: the strap lets the phone read a sleep
// record while the sleep is still going on, so a stored end near the wake time can be minutes before
// the sync that read it, hours before the real wake.
