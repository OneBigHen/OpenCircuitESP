// VO2MaxHealthWriter.swift — writes a run's VO₂ max ESTIMATE to Apple Health (#232), asking for the
// `vo2Max` share grant lazily: the first time an estimate is about to be written, never at launch.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS IS A SECOND AUTHORIZATION REQUEST, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE THE BUILD-50 DEFECT.
// `HealthKitWriter.requestAuthorization()` is otherwise the app's one request, and that rule is a scar
// (see `HealthKitWriter.authorizationReadTypes`): build 50 added a request naming a type the main
// request ALSO named, with a different share/read membership, and testers lost the workout write grant
// in a loop (#210 is the same family). The property that made that reachable is "two requests
// disagree about one type". This request names exactly one type, `vo2Max`, in `toShare`, with an
// empty read set, and `vo2Max` is in NEITHER of the main request's sets — so no type ever appears in
// two requests. Both halves are pinned by tests:
//   • `HealthKitAuthorizationSurfaceTests` (Kit, source audit) allows this file exactly one request,
//     requires it to share only `vo2MaxType` and read nothing, and forbids the vo2Max HealthKit
//     type anywhere else in the app;
//   • `HealthKitShareTypesTests` (app) asserts `vo2Max` is in neither `allTypes` nor
//     `authorizationReadTypes`.
// Keeping `vo2Max` out of `allTypes` is also what keeps it off the launch path: the #129 upgrade
// re-prompt (`authorizationPromptAvailable`) probes `allTypes`, so adding it there would put a sheet
// in front of every existing install on launch — which the brief for #232 rules out.
//
// What has NOT been observed: this request running on a device that already holds the main grant.
// The PR asks for that on-phone check (grant VO₂ max, then confirm Workouts and Heart Rate are still
// on in Health ▸ Sharing ▸ Apps ▸ OpenCircuit).
